# Changelog

## Unreleased

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added more unstable support for toolchain plugins.
  - In the project graph:
    - Extend projects with dependencies, tasks, and an alias.
  - In the action pipeline:
    - Added `SetupEnvironment` action that executes the `setup_environment` WASM API.
    - Added `InstallDependencies` action that executes the `install_dependencies` WASM API.
  - When running tasks:
    - Extend the command/script with additional parameters before executing.
    - Inject dependency and lock information into the hash.
  - With Docker:
    - Updated `docker prune` to utilize the new WASM APIs for toolchain plugins.

## 1.35.3

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated remote uploads/downloads to abort when receiving a ctrl+c.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where interrupting (ctrl+c) a task that exits with a 0 code would treat is as
  succesful, resulting in an invalid cache.

## 1.35.2

#### 🚀 Updates

## 1.35.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Rewrote the action graph to support plugins. The following changes have been made.
  - Is now async compatible. In the future, we'll update it to also support concurrency, so that the
    graph can be built in parallel across threads.
  - Reduced the amount of edges (relationships) being created between nodes (actions).
  - Added a new `InstallDependencies` action for WASM plugins.
    - The dependencies root is now dynamically located by traversing the file system, unlike the
      previous implementation that assumed everything was in the workspace root.
  - Added a new `SetupEnvironment` action for WASM plugins.
    - This runs after `SetupToolchain` but before `InstallDependencies`.
    - Can be used to setup the workspace or project environment. For example, initializing Python
      venv, or making manifest/lockfile changes.
  - Updated `RunTask` to setup toolchains and install dependencies for each `toolchain` that has
    been configured, instead of just the 1st one (work in progress).
  - Updated `SyncProject` to no longer depend on `SetupToolchain`, and not be grouped by
    language/toolchain, and instead encompass all of them applicable to the project.
- Added a new task option, `cacheKey`, which can be used to seed the hash, and invalidate local and
  remote caches.
- Added a new task option, `priority`, that controls the position in the pipeline queue.
  - Supports `critical`, `high`, `normal` (default), or `low`.
- Added a `--log=verbose` level, which includes span information on top of the trace level.
- Added a light terminal theme. Can be enabled with `--theme=light` or `MOON_THEME=light`.
  - This is still a work in progress. Open to feedback on color/contrast choices.
- Added 2 new webhooks, `toolchain.installing` and `toolchain.installed`, which emit when a
  toolchain WASM plugin is installing a tool (via proto).
- Enabled the `experiments.fasterGlobWalk` and `experiments.gitV2` experiments.

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Added tier 3 support (tier 2 still a work in progress).
  - This utilizes the same APIs as proto: https://moonrepo.dev/docs/proto/wasm-plugin
- Added new toolchain WASM APIs.
  - `locate_dependencies_root` - Locates the dependencies root (workspace).
  - `setup_environment` - Runs operations to setup an environment for a project/workspace before
    installing dependencies and running tasks.
  - `install_dependencies` - Defines commands to install/dedupe dependencies.
  - `setup_toolchain` - Runs operations after the tool has been installed.
  - `teardown_toolchain` - Runs operations before the tool will be uninstalled.

## 1.34.2

#### 🚀 Updates

- Minor change to remote caching up/download batching to increase performance.
- Reworked remote caching error handling.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where remote caching would fail to upload multiple blobs if the sum of their sizes
  exceed the max upload size.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 1.34.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed a compilation error when moon is installed through Cargo.
- Fixed the version missing in `--version` and `--help`.
- Fixed text wrapping issues when rendering tables in the terminal.

## 1.34.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- We have sunset our [moonbase](https://moonrepo.app/) service and removed its integration from
  moon. If you were using moonbase's remote caching, we suggest using
  [Depot or self-hosting](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/guides/remote-cache) instead.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Integrated a new console rendering system with new terminal styles, prompts, and output.
  - Updated all applicable commands.
  - Updated `moon templates` to render a list of data.
  - Updated `moon query projects` and `moon query tasks` to render a table of data.
- Added new settings to `pipeline` (formerly `runner`) in `.moon/workspace.yml` to control which
  kinds of action nodes exist in the action graph when running tasks.
  - `syncWorkspace` setting toggles the root `SyncWorkspace` action.
  - `syncProjects` setting toggles the `SyncProject` actions, and can be scoped to project IDs.
  - `syncProjectDependencies` setting toggles whether to recursively link `SyncProject` actions
    based on project dependencies.
  - `installDependencies` setting toggles the `InstallWorkspaceDeps` and `InstallProjectDeps`
    actions, and can be scoped to toolchain IDs.
- Added an `experiments.fasterGlobWalk` setting to `.moon/workspace.yml`, that will use a better
  glob walker implementation. Do note that this is experimental and may be buggy!
  - In our benchmarks, it's on average 1.5-2x faster.
  - We also attempt to cache the results, which occurs quite often when running tasks.
  - Globs are now logged to better debug performance issues.
- Added an `experiments.gitV2` setting to `.moon/workspace.yml`, that uses a new Git implementation.
  - Has better support for submodules, subtrees, and worktrees.
  - Parallelizes processes when applicable.
  - Covers edge cases the v1 implementation did not support.
- Added a `--no-actions` flag to `moon run`, that will run the task without including the other
  actions, like `SyncProject`, `SetupToolchain`, etc.
- Added a `--json` flag to `moon templates`.
- Deprecated the `pipeline.archivableTargets` setting. All tasks are now automatically cached if
  using Bazel Remote Caching.
- Improved the performance of environment variable substitution.
- Improved toolchain plugin loading to be on-demand.
- Improved sync cache invalidation for codeowners, config schemas, and VCS hooks.
- Updated `moon docker file` to inherit the default Docker image from any applicable toolchain
  plugins.

- Updated proto to [v0.47.7](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.47.7) (from 0.47.4).
- Updated dependencies.

## 1.33.2

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added `MOON_REMOTE_*` environment variables for many `unstable_remote` settings.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where project toolchain detection would not take the `toolchain` disabled state in
  `moon.yml` into account.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 1.33.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where internal tasks could be ran when using the "run in closest project"
  shorthand.
- Fixed an issue where the task `preset` would sometimes not be inherited when using `extends`.

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Updated `typescript_toolchain` to v0.1.3.
  - Will no longer error if a file in `extends` is missing during task hashing.

## 1.33.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- Changed the way to disable the TypeScript toolchain in `moon.yml`.
  ```yml
  # Before
  toolchain:
    typescript:
      disable: true
  # After
  toolchain:
    typescript: false # or null
  ```
- Removed the `--include` option from `moon docker scaffold` (it's been long deprecated). Use the
  `docker` settings instead.

#### 🚀 Updates

- The TypeScript toolchain is now powered by a
  [WASM plugin](https://github.com/moonrepo/plugins/tree/master/toolchains/typescript). This is our
  first step in supporting plugins in core. We chose TypeScript as our 1st plugin because it was the
  simplest of all the toolchains, and primarily was used for project syncing.
  - Plugins must be downloaded from the internet, so a connection is required on the first run. The
    plugin is then cached locally.
  - Most of the code had to be rewritten but we tried to keep as much parity as possible. Please
    report an issues or differences you encounter.
  - Because TypeScript is now a "true" toolchain, it will appear in the toolchains list for projects
    and tasks. This is required since it runs operations in the context of the plugin.
  - All `typescript` settings in `.moon/toolchain.yml` can now be defined as overrides in
    `moon.yml`.
- Added new toolchain plugin integrations for specific features.
  - Integrated into the `SyncWorkspace` and `SyncProject` actions.
  - Integrated into all `moon docker` commands.
  - Integrated into the task hashing process.
- Added a new `moonx` executable, which is a shorthand for `moon run`.
  - Right now the implementation uses Bash/PowerShell shims, but will be migrated to a true binary
    executable once we rework our release process.
  - The shims are dynamically created the first time moon runs, relative to the executed `moon`
    binary.
- Added support for `moon run ~:build`, which will run the `build` task in the closest project
  (traversing upwards).
- Added `$XDG_DATA_HOME` support when detecting the moon store. Will be used if `$MOON_HOME` is not
  set, and will fallback to `$HOME/.moon`.
- Added elapsed/timing information to child processes and WASM calls within logs.
- Improved the handling of CTRL-C, CTRL-BREAK, and other signals on Windows.
- Updated `moon init` with toolchain plugin support.
- Updated `toolchain.default` in `moon.yml` to support a list of IDs.
- Updated `unstable_remote.auth.headers` to support environment variable interpolation.
- Updated generated JSON schemas at `.moon/cache/schemas` to dynamically include toolchain plugin
  configuration.
- Updated file hashing (via `git hash-object`) to continously pipe stdin to avoid hanging processes.
- Deprecated `hasher.batchSize` in `.moon/workspace.yml`.

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Added new toolchain WASM APIs.
  - `register_toolchain` - Registers the toolchain and provide metadata for detection and other
    purposes.
  - `initialize_toolchain` - Provides prompts to use during `moon init` to gather settings values.
  - `define_toolchain_config` - Defines a configuration schema for use within JSON schemas.
  - `define_docker_metadata` - Defines metadata related to `docker` commands.
  - `hash_task_contents` - Injects content into the task hashing process.
  - `prune_docker` - Custom operations to run during `docker prune`.
  - `scaffold_docker` - Custom operations to run during `docker scaffold`.
  - `sync_project` - Runs syncing operations per project (during the `SyncProject` action).
  - `sync_workspace` - Runs syncing operations at the workspace root (during the `SyncWorkspace`
    action).
- Updated `download_extension` to v0.0.9.
- Updated `migrate_nx_extension` to v0.0.9.
  - Will no longer remove Nx configs. Pass `--cleanup` to remove them.
- Updated `migrate_turborepo_extension` to v0.1.6.
  - Will no longer remove Turborepo configs. Pass `--cleanup` to remove them.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where file hashing (`git hash-object`) would hang when there are too many files
  being hashed.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated proto to [v0.47.4](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.47.0) (from 0.45.2).
- Updated Rust to v1.85.
- Updated dependencies.
- Removed JSON schemas from the GitHub release.

- Fixed an issue where `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` would sometimes not be parsed.

## 1.32.4

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where a project could be inserted into the project graph multiple times.
- Fixed an issue where touched files would sometimes not be available outside of affected scopes.

## 1.32.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `moon setup` wouldn't load configuration.
- Fixed an issue where `moon docker scaffold` would unexpectedly install the toolchain languages.
- Fixed an issue where `moon docker scaffold` would not copy `uv.toml` and `uv.lock` files.
- Fixed an issue where changing `python.version` wouldn't regenerate the Python virtual environment.

## 1.32.2

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `NO_COLOR` or `FORCE_COLOR` would be overwritten for task child processes.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated proto to [v0.45.2](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.45.2) (from 0.45.1).
- Updated dependencies.

## 1.32.1

  child processes when a signal is received. Defaults to 2 seconds.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `bash` and `batch` project language's would not inherit tasks.
- Fixed some `bun.lock` parsing issues.

## 1.32.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added unstable support for multiple package workspaces when installing dependencies and resolving
  lockfiles.
  - For example, you can now have multiple `yarn.lock` files throughout the repository, allowing for
    multiple Yarn/Node workspaces.
- Updated Pkl (`.pkl`) based configuration to always be enabled, and is no longer hidden behind an
  experimental flag.
  - Added official documentation: https://moonrepo.dev/docs/guides/pkl-config
- Updated our unstable remote service (Bazel RE API) with new functionality:
  - You can now use `http(s)` protocols for gRPC servers, instead of just `grpc(s)`.
  - Added an `unstable_remote.api` setting, which can be used to inform the server's API format.
    Defaults to `grpc`.
  - Added an `unstable_remote.auth` setting, which can be used for HTTP Bearer/token Authorization
    based endpoints. Can also be used to set headers for all requests.

  - Added support for the HTTP protocol: https://bazel.build/remote/caching#http-caching
  - Added support for the ByteStream API.
  - Added timeout and concurrency limit to clients.
  - Added a `MOON_DEBUG_REMOTE` environment variable, which can be used to debug internal errors for
    diagnosing connection/integration issues.
  - Improved handling of TLS/mTLS connections.
- Improved the Bun toolchain.
  - Added support for the new v1.2 `bun.lock` file. We do our best to detect this, but we suggest
    configuring `--save-text-lockfile`.

    settings.
    - Right now, has basic toolchain support, including dependency installs and virtual
      environments.

    the Cargo workspace.
  - Project dependencies (`dependsOn`) are now automatically inferred from `Cargo.toml`
    dependencies.
- Reworked child process handling to better handle signals and shutdown accordingly. Additionally,
  when the pipeline receives a signal, we now display the status that shutdown the pipeline in the
  summary.
- Reworked the new task `inferInputs` option to not infer environment variables from popular CI/CD
  providers, as those values constantly change, causing tasks to always be affected. If you would
  like to reference these values, add them as an explicit inputs.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed lots of issues around remote caching. Should be "stable" now.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated Rust to v1.84.1.

## 1.31.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- This patch upgrades proto to the latest version to fix some bin locating issues that you may have
  encountered if you have proto v0.45 installed on your system, which conflicts with the proto v0.44
  that moon installs.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated proto to [v0.45.1](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.45.1) (from 0.44.4).

## 1.31.2

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added file locks for certain operations to avoid race collisions when multiple `moon` commands are
  ran in parallel.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where inferred inputs would include directories that would log a warning and fail
  to be hashed.

## 1.31.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed `NO_COLOR` and `FORCE_COLOR` being unexpectedly set in some situations.
- Fixed an issue where a custom project `language` would no longer inherit global tasks of the same
  name.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated proto to [v0.44.4](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.44.4) (from 0.44.2).

## 1.31.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- We've updated the task inheritance order to better reflect specificity. The biggest changes are
  that deno/node/bun are now a higher priority than javascript/typescript, and stack is the lowest
  priority. This should only affect users with very complex inheritance chains.

#### 🚀 Updates

- We are deprecating the concept of the "platform", as this is required for the next step in
  supporting WASM based toolchain plugins. Going forward, any reference to platform is now a
  toolchain. The following changes have been made:
  - Deprecated the top-level `platform` setting in `moon.yml`, use `toolchain.default` instead.
    - Additionally, the toolchain can now be inferred from the top-level `language` setting and any
      config files in the project/workspace root. This pattern is preferred when possible.
  - Deprecated the `platform` task setting, use `toolchain` instead.
  - Deprecated the `taskPlatform` query field, use `taskToolchain` instead.
  - Deprecated the `--platform` option for `moon query tasks`, use `--toolchain` instead.
  - Deprecated the `$taskPlatform` token, use `$taskToolchain` instead.
- Added the ability to run targets in `moon run` and `moon ci` using a glob-like syntax.
  - For example: `:build-*`, `app-*:build`, `#tag-{foo,bar}:build`, etc.
- Added a `--no-bail` flag to `moon run`, that will continue running tasks even when a task fails.
- Added glob support (and `glob://`) to `generator.templates` in `.moon/workspace.yml`, allowing you
  to glob for your codegen template locations.
- Added a task option `inferInputs`, that will automatically infer inputs based on file groups and
  substituted environment variables used within the task.
- Updated task option `runInCI` to support the values "always" (always run) and "affected" (only run
  if affected, same as `true`).
- Updated task inputs to automatically be inherited from file group token functions used within the
  task's `script`, `command`, `args`, or `env`.
- Updated the `extends` setting in `.moon/workspace.yml`, `toolchain.yml`, and `tasks.yml`, to
  support a list of files/URLs to extend.
- Updated our unstable remote service (Bazel RE API) with new functionality:
  - Added an `unstable_remote.cache.compression` setting, which can be set to `zstd` to enable
    zstandard compression on output blobs.
  - Symlink based outputs will now be created as symlinks on Windows, where previously they were
    copies. Do note that symlinks require
    [privileged access on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/create-symbolic-links)
    to function correctly.
- Updated the `moon templates` command:
  - Templates are now sorted by identifier.
  - Added a `--filter` option to filter the templates list by ID.
- Updated toolchain dependency installs to retry up to 3 attempts if the install command fails.
- Improved the task output prefixing logic.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed a panic that could occur during command argument parsing.
- Fixed an issue where remote cached blobs would sometimes fail to be created locally.
- Fixed an issue when `ctrl+c`ing multiple persistent tasks would sometimes leave them running in
  the background.

- Updated dependencies.

## 1.30.6

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `python venv` would fail to find an applicable Python version.
- Fixed an issue with PowerShell Git hooks not bubbling up exit codes of failed commands.
- Fixed an issue where Git submodules/worktrees would point to the wrong hooks folder.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated proto to v0.44.1 (from 0.43.1).

## 1.30.5

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed Python virtual env bin path not being available for tasks when `python.version` is not
  defined.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 1.30.4

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed `moon ci` showing incorrect job related logs.
- Fixed some issues with the Python toolchain:
  - pip is no longer required to be enabled to activate a virtual environment.
  - Changed `python.rootRequirementsOnly` to `false` by default.
  - The venv root is now the location of a found `requirements.txt`, otherwise the package root, or
    workspace root if `python.rootRequirementsOnly` is enabled.
  - Tasks will now inherit the correct venv paths in `PATH`.

## 1.30.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where a task with explicit no inputs (`inputs: []`) would always be marked as
  affected.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated proto to v0.43.0 (from 0.42.2).
- Updated wasmtime to v26 (from v23).
- Updated Rust to v1.83.

## 1.30.2

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where dependencies/dependents of an affected task would be skipped in the action
  graph if they were also not affected.
- Fixed a potential cycle (stack overflow) that may occur in the affected tracker.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Improved task dependent resolution in the action graph.

## 1.30.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed a Git "fatal: bad object" error when submodules are in being used.
- Fixed an issue where `moon ci` would trigger a shallow checkout error, even when a base revision
  is provided.
- Fixed an issue were changes in a non-direct dependency would not mark a deep dependent as
  affected.

## 1.30.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- If you renamed a project using the `id` setting in `moon.yml`, you can no longer reference that
  project in dependencies and targets using its original ID.
- Refactored the `moon query tasks` command.
  - CLI options have been replaced with new task based options, instead of being project based.
  - Now utilizes the new task graph and affected tracker.
- The `moon project-graph --json` output no longer includes task data (the `tasks` field is an empty
  map).
  - Use `moon task-graph` to access this data, and piece things together using the project
    `taskTargets` field.
  - The `moon project --json` output pieces everything together automatically.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added _unstable_ support for self-hosted remote caches, powered by the
  [Bazel Remote Execution API](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis).
  - Allows for 3rd-party implementations like
    [`bazel-remote`](https://github.com/buchgr/bazel-remote) to be used.
  - Currently supports the gRPC protocol, and will support HTTP in a later release.
  - Our moonbase product will be sunset in the future.

  direct relationships.
- Fixed an issue where touched file paths would include Git submodule directories and trigger hasher
  warnings.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.
- Updated proto to v0.42.2 (from 0.42.0).

## 1.29.4

  disallow using original IDs for renamed projects (via the `id` setting) when building the project
  graph.
- Updated codegen/template `destination` to be relative from the workspace root if prefixed with
  `/`, otherwise the current working directory.

#### 🐞 Fixes

#### 🚀 Updates

- Removed the warning around `.env` files not existing in certain environments.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the task option `timeout` would apply to the overall run, and not for each
  attempt when using the `retryCount` option.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated Rust to v1.82.

## 1.29.1

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a new task option `merge`, that defines the same strategy for all applicable fields. Can be
  overridden with `mergeX` task options.
- Added a `moon` setting to `.moon/toolchain.yml`, which can be used to customize the update check
  process.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed `moon query projects` including dependency projects by default. Can be controlled with
  `--upstream`.
- Fixed `moon query projects` regex patterns not working when used in conjunction with affected.

  args, deps, and env in inheriting tasks.
- Fixed an issue where token variables and environment variables used within task args together
  would not be replaced correctly.

## 1.29.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Implemented a new affected project tracker that is more accurate and more powerful.
  - Can now control the depth of upstream (dependencies) and downstream (dependents).
  - Affected information now logs more information and is included in reports/JSON.
  - Added `--upstream` and `--downstream` options to `moon query projects`.
  - Coming soon for affected tasks as well!
- Implemented experimental support for a new configuration language, [Pkl](https://pkl-lang.org)!
  - Pkl is programmable, allowing for variables, loops, conditionals, and more.
- Added a new task option, `cacheLifetime`, that controls how long a task will be cached for.

  toolchains via WASM plugins.
- Updated task `outputs` to support token and environment variables.
- Updated `moon query projects` to include the project description as a trailing value.
- Updated `moon query tasks` to include the task type and platform, and the task description as a
  trailing value.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where a root project in a polyrepo would not default to `**/*` inputs for tasks.
- Potential fix for an issue that occurs when multiple toolchains of the same type (2 different
  Node.js versions for example) would fail in weird ways when installing in parallel.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated identifiers and targets to use [compact strings](https://crates.io/crates/compact_str).
- Updated proto to v0.41.3 (from 0.40.4).
- Updated wasmtime to v23 (from v17).

## 1.28.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where VCS hooks were not being generated in Docker (requires `.git` to exist).
- Fixed an issue where projects whose `id` was renamed in `moon.yml` wasn't being reflected when
  inheriting project dependencies through the toolchain/platform integration.
- Fixed `optionalDependencies` not being considered a project relationship for Bun/Node implicit
  `package.json` detection.

## 1.28.2

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated cached task outputs to now be prefixed with the task target when printing to the console.
- Updated Bun/Yarn lockfile parsing to temporarily log a warning on parse failure instead of exiting
  with an error. This change was made as there are currently no actionable or human-readable error
  messages.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where empty lines were being trimmed while streaming task console output.
- Fixed an issue where tasks that errored _before_ the command is executed, would swallow the error
  in `moon ci`.
  - It would also put the task in a non-failed state depending on the order of operations. This
    should be correct now.

## 1.28.1

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added caching around `bun bun.lockb` commands, instead of running them for every task.
- Updated and loosened identifier naming restrictions.
- Updated environment variable substitution to support different outputs when a variable is missing,
  based on a trailing flag syntax.
  - `$FOO` or `${FOO}` - If variable is missing, keeps the original syntax (current default).
  - `$FOO?` or `${FOO?}` - If variable is missing, replaces with an empty string.
  - `$FOO!` or `${FOO!}` - Ignores variable substitution and preserves the syntax (without !).

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where an affected task with files that contain non-standard characters would fail
  to run because Bash expansion fails. We now quote file paths that contain `*`, `$`, `+`, and `[]`.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated Rust to v1.81.

## 1.28.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- Extensions (WASM plugins) must implement the `register_extension` API. All built-in extensions
  have been updated.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Resolved the `actionPipelineV2` experiment and the new pipeline is now always enabled. The old
  pipeline code has been deleted. If you run into any problems, please report an issue!
- Resolved the `strictProjectAliases` experiment and enabled its functionality going forward.
- Added a `preset` task setting, that enables a collection of task options.
  - Will be replacing the `local` setting, which is now deprecated.
- Added an `os` task option, which allows a specific operating system to be targeted for the task.
- Added a `@meta` token function that can access project metadata.
- Added `$projectName`, `$projectChannel`, and `$projectOwner` token variables.
- Added `codeowners.requiredApprovals` setting to `.moon/workspace.yml`, that will apply
  requirements to all paths.
- Added a new experiment `disallowRunInCiMismatch`, that errors when a task that is `runInCI`
  enabled depends on a task that is `runInCI` disabled. These kinds of relationships cause a handful
  of issues in the pipeline.
  - Currently this only applies to `moon ci` and may also apply to `moon run` in the future.
- Updated the terminal checkpoint (4 squares) colors to better reflect their state.
  - Cached tasks continue to be blue, but non-cached but successful tasks are now green.
  - Announcements are now yellow.
- Updated `MOON_TOOLCHAIN_FORCE_GLOBALS` to support filtering by tool IDs, instead of applying to
  everything.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- We've sunset the CI insights feature in moonbase. We will no longer be tracking CI run history.
  This is a retroactive change that applies to all moon versions.
- Updated proto to v0.40.4 (from v0.39.7).

## 1.27.10

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue around running dependents when a dependency is affected in CI.

## 1.27.9

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed a regression where the "primary target" detection would include far too many targets. This
  would result in passthrough arguments being unintentionally passed deeper.
- Fixed a regression where dependent tasks would always run in CI.

## 1.27.8

#### 🚀 Updates

- We now log messages when inheriting values from the root `.prototools`.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed a panic that occurs in the action graph builder.
- Fixed an issue where the root `.prototools` wasn't always loaded.

## 1.27.7

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where codeowners `requiredAppprovals` wouldn't allow `1`.
- Fixed an issue where a task that depends on another task that has `runInCI: false`, would not run
  as affected in `moon ci` because the dependency task was skipped.

## 1.27.6

#### 📢 Notice

There have been reports of the `moon.exe` binary being flagged as a Trojan on Windows. This looks to
be a common false positive (`Wacatac.B!ml`) that targets Rust built binaries (as seen in the
[Tauri project as well](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2486)).

While this isn't a simple fix on our end, we're publishing a new binary to replace the old one. You
may also have to unquarantine moon on your system. And lastly, we also suggest
[adding an exclusion for `moon.exe` to Windows Defender](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26).

  requests to finish. The old pipeline was not affected.
- Fixed `@in` and `@out` tokens not being able to reference other token functions.

## 1.27.2

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where file groups expanded with task `script` or `env` weren't resolving relative
  to the project or workspace root (based on options).

  escaping/quoting).
- Fixed an issue where a persistent task may not run or error with a missing dependency hash, if ran
  alongside many other persistent tasks.
- Fixed an issue where "build" dependencies were being synced as project references.
- Fixed an issue where the install dependencies action wouldn't run if the vendor directory
  (node_modules) was missing, but our operation was previously cached.

  - If you run into any issues running tasks, disable this setting and report an issue.
- Added a new task field `script`, as an alternative to `command` + `args`.
  - Scripts support multiple commands (`&&`), pipes, and redirects.
  - Scripts do not support task inheritance argument merging.
  - Scripts are always ran in a shell.
- Added a new command, `moon docker file`, that can be used to generate an initial multi-stage
  `Dockerfile` for a project.
- Added new `docker` settings to both `.moon/workspace.yml` and `moon.yml`, allowing it to be
  configured at the workspace and project levels.
- Added support for [murex](https://murex.rocks/) shells.
  - Updated both `unixShell` and `windowsShell` task options.
- Improved the "automatically install dependencies if a manifest/lockfile has changed" flow. This
  should trigger less than before.
- We now generate JSON schemas for our configuration files to `.moon/cache/schemas`, so that they
  can be dynamically created based on the current moon version and environment.
  - Is automatically generated when running a task.
  - Added a `moon sync config-schemas` command to manually run this operation.

  not exist.
- Respect `CARGO_HOME` during automatic rustup installation.

## 1.26.5

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated home-based environment variables, like `CARGO_HOME`, to support relative paths.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where globs wouldn't match when leading with `./`.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated proto to v0.37.2 (from v0.37.1).

## 1.26.4

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the shell could not be detected, and would potentially hang.

## 1.26.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- Reworked webhooks to more closely align with our current data structures.
  - Renamed `target.*` events to `task.*`, and `*.finished` to `*.completed`.
  - Removed the `pipeline.aborted` event. Instead, an `aborted` field is now passed to
    `pipeline.completed`.
  - Replaced the `action` field with a new `node` field within `task.*` events.
  - Reworked `pipeline.completed` entirely. Instead of calculating values for you, we now pass all
    results allowing you to calculate them yourself.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Rewrote the actions/tasks pipeline from the ground-up. Is currently experimental and must be
  enabled with the `experiments.actionPipelineV2` setting in `.moon/workspace.yml`.
  - Increased performance.
  - Better concurrency handling and scheduling.
  - More accurately monitors signals (ctrl+c) and shutdowns.
  - Tasks can now be configured with a timeout (`options.timeout` setting).
  - Some operations within actions are now ran in parallel.
  - We renamed many of the action labels (`SyncNodeProject(app)` -> `SyncProject(node, app)`).
- Added a global `--dump` flag, that will dump a trace profile that can be inspected in
  `chrome://tracing`.
- Updated `moon completions` command to support Nushell.
- Updated task option `unixShell` with new options: ion, nu (nushell), pwsh (powershell), xonsh.
- Updated task option `windowsShell` with new options: elvish, fish, nu (nushell), xonsh.
- Updated CLI command execution to be more performant, and to reduce our usage of concurrent locks.
  - Internal components (like cache engine, or project graph) are now lazy-loaded when required,
    instead of created upfront.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated proto to v0.37.1 (from v0.36.2).
- Updated Rust to v1.79.

## 1.25.6

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed a potential deadlock when installing tools.

- Fixed an issue where the `package.json` `packageManager` field would be set with an invalid
  version specifier.

## 1.25.4

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated `bun.version` and `node.bun.version` to stay in sync when one is defined and the other
  isn't. This helps to avoid tool discrepancies.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where persistent tasks depending on each other would sometimes error with
  "Encountered a missing hash".
- Fixed nightly and canary releases not showing the correct version in `moon --version`.

## 1.25.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed `git` version parsing when the version contains invalid semver parts.

#### 🔋 Extensions

- Updated `download` to v0.0.5.
- Updated `migrate-nx` to v0.0.5.
- Updated `migrate-turborepo` to v0.1.2.
  - Added Turborepo v2 support.

## 1.25.2

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a check to `moon docker scaffold` that ensures that `.moon/cache` is ignored in a root
  `.dockerignore` file. This helps to avoid interoperability issues.
- Added more logs to `moon docker` commands to help uncover future issues.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `noop` tasks would not cache / invalidate cache. This is a regression from
  the recent task runner changes.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated proto to v0.36.0 (from v0.35.4).

## 1.25.1

#### 🚀 Updates

- Rewrote process failure error messages to include exit status information. This should help
  uncover processes killed by signals, and help debug the -1 exit code issues.

## 1.25.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- Removed the following webhook events associated with task outputs: `target-output.archiving`,
  `target-output.archived`, `target-output.hydrating`, `target-output.hydrated`,
  `target-output.cache-check`.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Rewrote the task runner from the ground up:
  - Improved handling and reliability of output archiving and hydration.
  - Streamlined the task execution (child process) flow.
  - Now tracks metrics for individual operations, like hash generation, output hydration, task
    execution, and more. Can be inspected in the run report.
- Added a `--summary` flag to `moon run` and `moon check` that will include a summary of all actions
  that were processed/failed within the pipeline. This is the same output used in `moon ci`.
- Added a new console reporting layer that handles the rendering of output in the terminal.
  - This enables us to support additional reporters in the future, each with unique UIs.
  - Slightly tweaked our current UI rendering. You may notice some differences.
- Updated external configuration files (via https extends) to be cached for 24 hours.
  - This will fix issues with offline mode.
- Greatly reduced the amount of concurrent locks being held during task execution. May see slight
  performance improvements.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where actions within the run report were not reflecting the correct status of their
  last execution attempt.
- Fixed an issue where "have outputs been created" checks would fail if outputs only contained
  negated globs, coupled with literal paths.
- Fixed an issue where `.prototools` in the workspace root was not being respected when running moon
  commands in a sub-directory.
- Fixed `PROTO_*_VERSION` environment variables being set to `*`, resulting in unexpected versions
  being resolved.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated proto to v0.35.4 (from v0.34.4).
- Updated macOS binaries to be built on macos-12 instead of macos-11.

## 1.24.6

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Reworked the binary provided by `@moonrepo/cli` to work better on Windows.

## 1.24.5

#### 🐞 Fixes

## 1.24.4

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed a regression where `runInCI` was being overzealously applied to `moon run` commands.
- Fixed generated VCS hooks not containing a trailing newline.

## 1.24.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where internal tasks would still run when running a task using "closest project"
  detection.
- Fixed an issue where task's with `runInCI` weren't always being filtered properly.

## 1.24.2

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed task `deps.env` not supporting variable substitution.
- Fixed an issue where Git hooks would overwrite non-local hooks. The `core.hooksPath` setting is
  now only used if the path is within the current repository.

## 1.24.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where versions in `.prototools` weren't being respected.
- Fixed task `deps.args` and `deps.env` not expanding tokens correctly.

## 1.24.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added an experimental `moon templates` command, that lists all available codegen templates.
- Added a `--dependents` flag to `moon project-graph <id>` and `moon query projects`, to include
  downstream dependents of a focused/affected project.
- Added a `mutex` task option, allowing for exclusivity and to ensure only 1 task is running at a
  time for the same mutex.
- Added a `runner.autoCleanCache` setting to `.moon/workspace.yml`, allowing the post-run clean
  mechanism to be controlled.
- Updated `moon ci` to automatically determine base/head revisions based on your current CI provider
  (when applicable).
- Updated `moon generate`:
  - When passing variables as command line arguments, they are now entirely modeled after the
    template configuration.
    - Booleans and negated booleans now work better.
    - Numbers now support negative values.
    - Multiple values can now be passed for enums when `multiple` is enabled.
  - If a variable value is passed as an argument, we no longer prompt for it.
  - Internal variables will now error when passed as an argument.
- Updated action graph and project graph visualization:
  - Slightly tweaked the colors to be easier to read.
  - Updated edges to use chevron arrows.
  - Added a new layout system to organize node/edges, controlled by the `?layout=` query parameter.
  - Supported layout options: `dagre` (default), `klay`, `grid`, `breadthfirst`
- Updated root-level tasks to have no inputs by default, instead of `**/*`. This is typically what
  users want, to avoid greedy tasks.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed YAML schema validation not allowing custom languages for the project `language` field.
- Fixed an issue where Bun and Node would both attempt to install dependencies, resulting in
  collisions.
  - To resolve this issue, we currently prioritize Node over Bun if both tools are enabled.
  - If you have both and want to use Bun, set Node's package manager to
    `node.packageManager: 'bun'`.
- Attempted fix for "too many open files" when moon is cleaning cached artifacts.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated proto to v0.34.4 (from v0.32.2).

## 1.23.4

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where leading `./` in input/output globs would cause matching failures.
- Fixed an issue where root-level projects were not being marked as affected in `moon query`.
- Fixed an issue where `moon docker scaffold` would copy all sources when a project depends on a
  root-level project.

## 1.23.3

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Updated `bun_plugin` to v0.11.
  - Added Windows support.
  - Will now use the baseline build on x64 Linux when available.

#### 🔋 Extensions

- Updated `migrate-nx` to v0.0.3.
  - Fixed invalid IDs when converting `package.json` names.

## 1.23.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added `git:` and `npm:` locators to the `generator.templates` setting in `.moon/workspace.yml`.
  - This allows templates to be packaged and managed outside of the workspace.
  - Locations will be cloned/downloaded on-demand.
- Added an `id` setting to `template.yml`, so that templates can customize their name (instead of
  using the folder name).
- Added a `variables()` function for templates that returns an object of all variables available.
- Added new functionality for template variables in `template.yml`:
  - New `order` setting to control the order in which they are prompted for.
  - New `internal` setting that ignores values passed on the command line.
  - Updated enum `default` settings to support an array of values.

- Updated `moon project` and `moon task` to include the configuration files that tasks inherit from.
- Updated `moon task` to include the modes it belongs to.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where a project's `platform` was being detected as `node` (when not enabled), and
  should have been `bun`. If you're using both `bun` and `node` in the same workspace, moon has a
  hard time detecting which should be used for what project. If you run into issues, explicitly set
  the `platform` in the project's `moon.yml`.
- Fixed an issue where template files couldn't import/include/extends files from extended templates.
- Fixed template enum variable default values being able to use a non-supported value.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Configuration JSON schemas are now included within each GitHub release.
- Updated proto to v0.32.1 (from v0.31.4).

  fail to compile as they were missing a lib/main entry point.
- Fixed an issue with `moon docker prune` where an unknown project type would trigger toolchain
  errors.

## 1.22.8

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where task hashing would attempt to hash invalid file paths, when moon is located
  within a nested git repository.

## 1.22.7

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where environment variable substitution would trigger recursively when referencing
  itself.

## 1.22.6

#### 🚀 Updates

- We now include the exit code of a failing task in the logs for easier debugging.

#### 🐞 Fixes

## 1.22.1

#### 🚀 Updates

In v1.22, we [made a change](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/issues/1329) to affected tasks that
pass all `inputs` as arguments, instead of passing `.`. This change was made to not overzealously
pass files to the task that it doesn't care about, but it ended up causing problems for certain
commands.

We didn't want to revert the change, but it also wasn't easy to fix without causing other issues, so
as a compromise, we opted to introduce a new task option, `affectedPassInputs` to handle this
functionality.

## 1.22.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added `configuration` and `scaffolding` variants to the project `type` setting in `moon.yml`.
  - Updated project constraints to support these new variants.
- Added a `stack` setting to `moon.yml`, for categorizing which tech stack it belongs to.
  - Supports `frontend`, `backend`, `infrastructure`, and `systems`.
  - Added a `projectStack` field to the query language (MQL).
  - Added a `$projectStack` token variable for tasks.

  - Updated the `moon project` and `moon task` commands to include the description in the output.
- Added an `installArgs` setting for bun/npm/pnpm/yarn in `.moon/toolchain.yml`, to customize the
  args used when installing dependencies.
- Added a new built-in extension, `migrate-nx`, for migrating from Nx to moon.
  - Will convert all `nx.json`, `workspace.json`, and `project.json` files.
- Updated task input environment variables to support a wildcard match using `*`, for example
  `$VITE_*`.
  - This will include all environment variables in the current process that starts with `VITE_`.
- Updated the `envFile` task option to support a list of file paths.
- Updated the `migrate-turborepo` extension.
  - Removed the requirement of moon's project graph. Will now scan for turbo.jsons instead.
- Updated affected tasks to use `inputs` as the list of files provided, instead of `.`.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `bun install` was not running with `--production` in Docker prune.
- Fixed an issue where invalid IDs passed to certain commands would trigger a panic.
- Fixed an issue where `$PWD` in a task was pointing to the wrong directory.

#### 🧩 Plugins

## 1.21.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added Deno tier 3 support.
  - Will download and install Deno into the toolchain when a `version` is configured.
  - Will parse the `deno.lock` lockfile to extract and resolve dependencies.
  - Will hash manifests and inputs for Deno specific caching.
  - Added a `deno.version` setting to `.moon/toolchain.yml`.

  Node.js.
- Added environment variable support to `fileGroups`.
- Added a `@envs(group)` token function for referencing environment variables.
- Added a `--quiet` global argument, for hiding non-critical moon output.
- Deprecated the `moon node run-script` command. Run the task through a package manager instead,
  like `npm run` or `yarn run`.
- Updated tasks with glob-like arguments to automatically enabled the `shell` option, so that glob
  expansion works correctly.
- Updated interactive tasks to not be shutdown when receiving a CTRL+C signal, and instead allow
  them to handle it themselves, and cleanup if necessary.
- Implemented a new console layer for writing to stdout/stderr.
  - Logs are now buffered and written periodically.
  - Previously they were written immediately, which required locking std each call.
  - Should see some minor performance improvements.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the action graph would create incorrect nodes when a tool utilizes dependency
  workspaces, and a project is not within the workspace.
- Fixed an issue where glob based arguments were overlay escaped.
- Fixed console checkpoints (the 4 squares) showing the wrong working directory.

#### ⚙️ Internal

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed `moon docker scaffold` not copying the project specific `moon.yml` file, resulting in a
  skewed project graph.

## 1.20.0

  - An extension is a WASM plugin that is not built into moon's core:
    https://github.com/moonrepo/moon-extensions
  - Extensions can be executed with the new `moon ext` command.
  - The community can build and publish their own extensions!
- Added a `taskOptions` setting to `.moon` task configs, allowing default task options to be
  defined.
  - These options will be merged and inherited as part of the configuration chain.
- Added an `optional` field to task `deps`, allowing the dependency to be optional during
  inheritance.
- Added a "Tags" view to the VSCode extension.
- Updated proto installation to trigger for all applicable commands, not just `moon run`,
  `moon check`, and `moon ci`.
  - Will also use the global proto version if available when there's no internet connection, and the
    moon required proto version has not been installed.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed Git version parsing when using VFSForGit.

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Updated `bun_plugin` to v0.9.
- Updated `node_plugin` and `node_depman_plugin` to v0.9.

## 1.19.2

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed another location where the `proto` binary was not available.

## 1.19.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed `proto` binary not being available in a Dockerfile when running `moon docker` commands.
- Fixed our `@moonrepo/cli` postinstall script not working correctly for Bun Arm64.

## 1.19.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- Removed the `experiments.interweavedTaskInheritance` setting from `.moon/workspace.yml`.
  Interweaved inheritance is now always enabled (was previously true by default).
- Removed the `experiments.taskOutputBoundaries` setting from `.moon/workspace.yml`. We opted to
  remove boundaries entirely, as they caused more problems than solved. Task outputs may now overlap
  without issue.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated `implicitDeps` in `.moon/tasks.yml` and task `deps` in `moon.yml` to support arguments and
  environment variables for the dependency target.
- Updated the action graph and pipeline to _not_ run the same target (but with different arguments
  and environment variable variations) in parallel, to avoid unexpected collisions.
- Updated VS Code extension to support multiple VS Code workspace folders.
- Improved code generation and templates:
  - Added a `destination` field to `template.yml`, to customize a default location.
  - Added a `extends` field to `template.yml`, allowing templates to extend and inherit other
    templates.
  - Updated `[var]` syntax to support filters: `[var | camel_case]`.

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Updated `bun_plugin` to v0.7.
- Updated `node_plugin` and `node_depman_plugin` to v0.7.
- Updated `rust_plugin` to v0.6.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated Rust to v1.75.
- Updated proto to v0.26.4 (from v0.25).

## 1.18.5

#### 🚀 Updates

- Reworked duplicate project ID/alias detection to be more accurate. Will also now error instead of
  warn when a duplicate is detected.
  - For aliases, the error can be disabled with the new `experiments.strictProjectAliases` setting
    in `.moon/workspace.yml`.
  - For project IDs, the error can not be disabled, as conflicting IDs will cause issues with the
    project graph.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed glob based project locating to not log warnings when a file is found and it starts with `.`
  (ignore dotfiles).
- Fixed project aliases potentially overwriting a project with the same name.

## 1.18.4

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated the proto installation step to download, unpack, and install using Rust, instead of
  relying on our Bash/PowerShell scripts. This should remove the requirement that openssl, tar, and
  other environment tools must exist.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated proto to v0.25.3.

## 1.18.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Rewrote toolchain based task running to use a path based approach.
  - Instead of manually locating an executable, we now rely on `PATH` to locate the executable.
  - Non-system tasks can now be wrapped in a shell using the `shell` option.
  - This approach will now benefit from proto shims and binaries.
  - We'll also download and install the `proto` binary if it does not exist.
- Reworked the `moon init` command.
  - Will no longer scaffold the toolchain configuration by default.
  - The tool to scaffold into a toolchain can be passed as an argument.
  - The path to initialize in is now behined the `--to` option.
  - Added support for the `bun` tool.
  - Simplified the workflow overall.
- Updated `moon.yml` to support customizing the project name using the `id` field.

  settings not including project references that were manually added (not auto-synced).
- Fixed the "a project already exists with alias" warnings when using Bun and Node together.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Added canary release support.
- Enabled wasmtime caching, which should improve performance of WASM plugins by 10-20%.
- Updated proto to v0.23.7.

## 1.17.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where we would fail to find Cargo binaries on Windows.

#### ⚙️ Internal

  - Updated task `platform` to support "bun".
- Improved TypeScript support.
  - Added a `typescript.root` setting to denote the TypeScript root.
  - Added a `typescript.includeSharedTypes` setting, for syncing a shared types path to all
    project's `include`.
  - Added a `typescript.includeProjectReferenceSources` setting, for syncing project reference files
    to all project's `include`.
  - Updated `typescript.syncProjectReferencesToPaths` setting to always include the wildcard, and
    not require an index file.
  - Improved project reference syncing and edge case handling.
- Improved JavaScript support.
  - Added `bun.rootPackageOnly` and `node.rootPackageOnly` settings to support the "one version
    rule" pattern.
  - Updated automatic dependency linking to use the `build` scope instead of `peer` scope. This
    should alleviate some of the pain points with `package.json` syncing.

- Added Bun as a supported Node.js package manager: `node.packageManager: 'bun'`.
- Added components and targets support for the Rust toolchain.
  - Added `rust.components` and `rust.targets` settings to `.moon/toolchain.yml`.
  - Will automatically be installed with `rustup` when the pipeline is ran.
- Added a `MOON_TOOLCHAIN_FORCE_GLOBALS` environment variable, that will force all toolchain tools
  to use the global binary available on `PATH`, instead of downloading and installing.
- Added an improved task inheritance chain resolver.
  - Global and local tasks are now interweaved within the chain, where as previously global was
    built first, then local.
  - To fallback to the previous behavior, set `experiments.interweavedTaskInheritance: false` in
    `.moon/workspace.yml`.
- Added a new project type `automation`, for projects like E2E and integration testing.
- Updated action graph cycle detection to list all nodes in the cycle (when detectable).

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where "raw" codegen files were sometimes being rendered, and failing with invalid
  syntax.
- Fixed an issue where task dependents for the non-primary targets were being included in the action
  graph.
- Fixed an issue with the project graph that would create duplicate nodes for deeply nested cycles.
- Fixed an issue where a cycle would be created in the action graph for the `SyncProject` action
  type.

## 1.15.1

#### 🚀 Updates

- Based on feedback, we've updated the automatic dependency linking to _not apply_ when the target
  is the root-level project. This should alleviate all unwanted cycles.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where Node.js dependency syncing would fail on `build` dependencies, and be over
  zealous with root-level projects.
- Improved detection of Rust `cargo-binstall` package.

## 1.15.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- Tasks that depend (via `deps`) on other tasks from arbitrary projects (the parent project doesn't
  implicitly or explicitly depend on the other project) will now automatically mark that other
  project as a "peer" dependency. For example, "b" becomes a peer dependency for "a".

#### 🎉 Release

- Rewrote the dependency graph from the ground-up:
  - Now known as the action graph.
  - All actions now depend on the `SyncWorkspace` action, instead of this action running
    arbitrarily.
  - Cleaned up dependency chains between actions, greatly reducing the number of nodes in the graph.
  - Renamed `RunTarget` to `RunTask`, including interactive and persistent variants.
- Updated the action graph to process using a topological queue, which executes actions on-demand in
  the thread pool when they are ready (dependencies have been met). Previously, we would sort
  topologically _into batches_, which worked, but resulted in many threads uselessly waiting for an
  action to run, which was blocked waiting for the current batch to complete.
  - For large graphs, this should result in a significant performance improvement.
  - Persistent tasks will still be ran as a batch, but since it's the last operation, it's fine.
- Released a new GitHub action,
  [`moonrepo/setup-toolchain`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-proto-and-moon-toolchains),
  that replaces both `setup-moon-action` and `setup-proto`.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a `moon action-graph` command.
- Added a `--dependents` argument to `moon action-graph`.
- Added the ability to skip non-`RunTask` actions using environment variables.
- Deprecated the `moon dep-graph` command.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where task dependents (via `moon ci` or `moon run --dependents`) wouldn't always
  locate all downstream tasks.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Added in-memory caching to project graph file system lookup operations.
- Updated Rust to v1.72.

## 1.14.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a `moon run` shorthand, where "run" can be omitted. For example, `moon run app:build` can be
  written as `moon app:build`.
  - This only works for targets that contain a `:`.
- Updated `moon ci` to support running an explicit list of targets, instead of running everything.
- Updated `node.version`, `npm.version`, `pnpm.version`, `yarn.version`, and `rust.version` to
  support partial versions and requirements/ranges like `1.2`, `1`, or `^1.2`.
- Updated `.moon/tasks` to support nested folders, for better organization of task files.

  resolved has changed. Previously it was task-level > .env file > project-level. Now it's
  task-level > project-level > .env file.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Rewrote the project graph from the ground-up:
  - Lazily built using a multi-pass approach.
  - Graph edges now indicate the type of relationship: development, production, build, peer.
  - Updated `moon project-graph --json` to include the fully expanded graph data.
- Identifiers (project names, file groups, etc) can now be prefixed with underscores (`_`).
- Added Poetry detection support for Python projects.
- Added an `experiments` setting to `.moon/workspace.yml`.
- **Tasks**

## 1.10.0

#### 💥 Breaking

> These changes are fixing edge cases that should not have been allowed, but may break existing
> repos. If these changes become troublesome, we'll revert.

- Tasks that configure the same outputs will now error. This change was made as multiple tasks
  writing to the same output location will cause caching and hydration issues.
- If a dependency of a task failed to run or was skipped, then the parent task will now be skipped.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added support for `MOON_BASE` and `MOON_HEAD` environment variables.
  - Will be used when diffing across branches or commits.
  - Works for both `moon ci` and `moon run`.
- Added `deno.bins` setting to `.moon/toolchain.yml`.
- Added `hasher.ignorePatterns` and `hasher.ignoreMissingPatterns` settings to
  `.moon/workspace.yml`.
- Updated `moon ci` to include a summary of all failed actions.
- Updated `moon run` to compare against the previous commit when running on the default branch and
  using `--remote`.
- Updated `rust.bins` in `.moon/toolchain.yml` to support an object for each bin entry.
  - Can denote bins as CI or local only.
  - Can force install bins.
- Updated the run report to include stderr/stdout for all attempts.
