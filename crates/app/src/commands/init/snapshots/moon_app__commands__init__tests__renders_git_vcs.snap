# REQUIRED: A map of all projects found within the workspace, or a list or file system globs.
# When using a map, each entry requires a unique project ID as the map key, and a file system
# path to the project folder as the map value. File paths are relative from the workspace root,
# and cannot reference projects located outside the workspace boundary.
