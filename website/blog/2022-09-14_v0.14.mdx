import Image from '@site/src/components/Image';

With this release, we've landed some new features that have been requested multiple times since
launch. A code generation and template scaffolding layer, as well as implicit dependency scanning
for the project graph!

## New `moon generate` command

Code generation is the staple of any large company or repository. Want to spin up a new application?
What about an npm package? Or maybe third-party integrations? Avoid copy-and-pasting existing code,
and instead generate it with the new `moon generate` command, which is powered by our new generator
system.

The generator will locate a template by name on the file system ("npm-package" in the example
below), prompt and interpolate variables, render the files with [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app/) (a
Rust based template engine), and write the files to the target destination.

```shell
# Generate code from a template to a target directory
$ moon generate npm-package ./packages/example
```

Learn more about [code generation in the official guide](../docs/guides/codegen)!

## Implicit dependency scanning

This has been a request since moon's official release, and it's finally here! Up until now, if you
wanted project-to-project dependency relationships, you had to explicitly declare them with
[`dependsOn`](../docs/config/project#dependson). But thanks to a
[ton of](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/pull/288)
[infrastructure](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/pull/249) and
[platform](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/pull/277) changes, we can now infer implicit
dependencies automatically!

We still suggest using explicit dependencies, as it provides more
[automation like project syncing](../docs/concepts/project#dependencies), but implicit is great for
adoption and migration purposes.

## Report CI runs on pull requests

We're fans of continuous and easily accessible feedback, and as such, have released a new GitHub
action, [`moonrepo/run-report-action`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/moon-ci-run-reports),
which reports the results of [`moon ci`](../docs/commands/ci) as a pull request comment. The report
looks something like the following:

<Image src={require('../static/img/github/run-report.png')} width="60%" />

## Other changes

View the
[official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/%40moonrepo%2Fcli%400.14.0) for a
full list of changes.

- When running in a Docker container, caching is disabled in an effort to greatly reduce the size of
  the image.
- Updated `moon setup` to also install Node.js dependencies.

## What's next?

Expect the following in the v0.15 release!

- Webhooks! Receive messages for all events in the action runner.
- Major Docker workflow improvements!
