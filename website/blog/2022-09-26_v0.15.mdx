With this release, we've focused heavily on Docker integration and enhancing the `Dockerfile`
workflow, as well as some minor quality of life improvements for template files and run reports.

## 1,000 ⭐️🌟⭐️!

Before we dive into the release, we want to thank everyone for the initial support, as we passed
[1,000 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon) earlier this week! moon was announced back
in June, and to reach this milestone in roughly 3 months is very exciting. We greatly appreciate the
support, and to everyone that is using moon and providing feedback, we thank you from the bottom of
our hearts!

We have a very long roadmap ahead of us, but are very excited to bring all of these features to you,
and to improve the overall developer experience for your monorepos! Here's to 10,000 stars!

## First-class Docker support

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a very popular tool that is typically a part of a developers
workflow, but is also a very tedious one, as `Dockerfile`s have to be manually curated for every
project. We aim to mitigate this problem by supporting Docker as a first-class feature, and by
introducing 2 new commands, [`moon docker scaffold`](../docs/commands/docker/scaffold) and
[`moon docker prune`](../docs/commands/docker/prune).

These commands will automate a `Dockerfile` as much as possible to effectively take advantage of
Docker's layer caching, multi-staged builds, to reduce the amount of manual `COPY` commands, to
reduce the overall size of the container or image, and much more. To demonstrate this, compare the
before and after `Dockerfile`s below!

## Frontmatter for template files

We released [templates and the generator in v0.14](./v0.14) for quick and easy code generation.
Since it was the initial release, it provided the bare minimum of features for common workflows.
We'll continually improve this system over each release, and have done just that for this release,
as all template files now support [frontmatter](../docs/guides/codegen#frontmatter)! Frontmatter is
a mechanism for declaring _per-file configuration_, and is denoted by `---` delimiters at the top of
the file.

This allows you to do some really cool stuff, like overriding the destination path of the file using
the `to` field, as well as taking full advantage of Tera's filters and conditional rendering!

```twig title="templates/react/components/base.tsx"
{% set component_name = name | pascal_case %}

---
to: components/{{ component_name }}.tsx
---

export function {{ component_name }}() {
	return <div />;
}
```
