With this release, we've landed a long standing request of supporting project-level overrides for
tools configured in the workspace, as well as some quality of life improvements for TypeScript.

<!--truncate-->

## Per-project tool version overrides

Since moons inception, our [toolchain](../docs/concepts/toolchain) has only supported a single
version of a tool (Node.js), as we wanted to embrace the single version policy and encourage all
consumers to keep their tooling version consistent across all projects for reliability. While this
works flawlessly, it's not entirely realistic, as many companies have legacy projects that are stuck
on older versions for whatever reason, and integrating them into moon was rather difficult.

Well no more! We've refactored our toolchain to support tool overrides on a project-by-project
basis. Since we only support Node.js at the moment, this can be achieved with the new
[`workspace.node.version`](../docs/config/project#node) setting in
[`moon.yml`](../docs/config/project).

For example, if your workspace Node.js version is configured as v18.

```yml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
node:
  version: '18.0.0'
```

You can now override this version at the project-level. Let's go with v14.

```yml title="<project>/moon.yml"
workspace:
  node:
    version: '14.0.0'
```

When running a task from a project with overrides, the toolchain will download, install, and
configure the new version behind the scenes. This new version will then be used to install
dependencies and execute the tasks commands.

> Although we now support overriding the tool version, the workspace configured package manager
> (`node.packageManager`) and associated version cannot be overridden. This is unlikely to change.

## Per-project dependency installs

Because of the toolchain refactor above, we now support per-project dependency installs as a welcome
side-effect. This is a necessary step in supporting new languages, especially for those that don't
install dependencies in the workspace for all projects, and must install them per project.

This also means that moon now supports non-`package.json` workspaces! If your repository _is not_
using npm/pnpm/yarn workspaces, or a project _is not_ listed within the workspaces glob list,
dependencies will be installed within the project.

## TypeScript improvements

### Routing `outDir` to the cache

A requirement for using project references is that each project must compile declarations (`.d.ts`)
so that consumers/dependees can resolve type information. While this makes sense, it becomes rather
unfortunate as each project folder is now littered with the declaration outputs, which are typically
gitignored.

To improve this experience, we're introducing a new setting
[`typescript.routeOutDirToCache`](../docs/config/workspace#routeoutdirtocache), that will update the
`outDir` compiler option of _all_ projects to route to moon's cache directory (which should already
be gitignored). This will standardize the use of project references for the entire repository.

For example, a project at "packages/components" will route to the following output directory:

```json title="<project>/tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "outDir": "../../.moon/cache/types/packages/components"
  }
}
```

> If you require declarations to live within the project, for example an npm package that ships
> types, you should introduce an additional configuration to handle this, like
> `tsconfig.build.json`.

### Mapping project references as `paths`

moon automatically keeps TypeScript project references in sync with the
[`typescript.syncProjectReferences`](../docs/config/workspace#syncprojectreferences) setting, which
is great, but we can take it further. With the new
[`typescript.syncProjectReferencesToPaths`](../docs/config/workspace#syncprojectreferencestopaths)
setting, project references (either synced or explicitly defined) will _also_ be mapped to the
`paths` compiler option, automating the list of import aliases.

For example, if a reference has the package name `@brand/components`, the `paths` will be mapped
with:

```json title="<project>/tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "paths": {
      "@brand/components": ["../shared/components/src/index.ts"],
      "@brand/components/*": ["../shared/components/src/*"]
    }
  },
  "references": [
    {
      "path": "../shared/components"
    }
  ]
}
```
