Happy Halloween 🎃 👻! With this spooky release, we've focused heavily on our internals and
benchmarking performance metrics, so it's rather light on new features, but we still have some to
show!

<!--truncate-->

## Improved projects configuration

When moon initially launched, it required defining all
[`projects`](../docs/config/workspace#projects) using a map. In v0.3, we added support for globs to
ease the burden of defining many projects. At this point, you had to choose between the 2 patterns,
which wasn't always ideal.

To improve upon this, you can now define a map _and_ globs using a 3rd pattern, like so.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
  globs:
    - 'apps/*'
    - 'packages/*'
  sources:
    www: 'www'
```

## Improved `moon init` flow

The `moon init` command hasn't changed much since our v0.1 release, and with many new features and
configurations over these last 18 releases, the initialization flow has fallen quite behind. We felt
it was the perfect time to modernize this command a bit.

On top of automatically detecting settings from the environment, the command will also now prompt
you with additional questions while configuring Node.js or TypeScript. Here's an example of this
flow:

<Image src={require('./img/v0.18/init-flow.png')} width="80%" />

Furthermore, the command also supports enabling a new tool (appending configuration to
`.moon/workspace.yml`) into an _existing_ moon repository, by running `moon init --tool <name>`.

## Customize `node` execution arguments

moon manages the Node.js binary in our toolchain, and runs all Node.js based tasks using this
binary, instead of relying on the binary found in the developer's environment. Because of this, how
`node` is executed is abstracted away from end users.

What if you wanted to use an [experimental loader](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#loaders) and
execute TypeScript code at _runtime_? Or to preserve symlinks? Well, you couldn't... but no longer,
as we've added a new setting, [`node.binExecArgs`](../docs/config/workspace#binexecargs), that
allows additional `node` [CLI arguments](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#options) to be defined,
that will be passed to _all_ executions.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2-4}
node:
  binExecArgs:
    - '--loader'
    - '@boost/module/loader'
```
