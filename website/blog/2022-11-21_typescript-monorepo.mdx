A common question in the JavaScript ecosystem is how to integrate TypeScript in a monorepo. This is
a fair question, as there's no in-depth source of truth, or one perfect way of doing it. However, we
took it upon ourselves to answer this question!

<!--truncate-->

Based on our experience scaling and managing frontend repositories in open source and large
companies like Airbnb and Coinbase, we're happy to
[announce an in-depth guide on using TypeScript project references in a monorepo](../docs/guides/node/typescript-project-refs)!

We hope you find this guide useful, and if you have any questions, feel free to discuss them in our
[Discord community](https://discord.gg/qCh9MEynv2)!
