With this release, we've focused heavily on future proofing our toolchain and how it integrates with
moon. We've also landed a handful of quality of life improvements.

## Breaking changes

To start, we have a few breaking changes this release to be aware of!

### Moved toolchain settings

The [`.moon/workspace.yml`](../docs/config/workspace) config file was getting rather bloated and
complicated, as it contained the projects list, settings for each toolchain language, and settings
for each supported service (runner, generator, etc). Furthermore, this file will keep getting larger
with each new language and service we support.

To future proof moon, and to land as many breaking changes before an official v1, we've decided to
move toolchain specific settings into a new file, [`.moon/toolchain.yml`](../docs/config/toolchain).
This new file will house all language and dependency manager specific settings.

To migrate, move the `node` and `typescript` settings from `.moon/workspace.yml` to
`.moon/toolchain.yml`.

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
node:
  # ...

typescript:
  # ...
```

### Moved project-level overrides

Continuing with the changes above, we've also moved the `workspace.node` and `workspace.typescript`
from [`moon.yml`](../docs/config/project) into a new parent field, `toolchain`. We think this makes
more sense.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
# Before
workspace:
  node:
    version: '...'

# After
toolchain:
  node:
    version: '...'
```

## Future of the toolchain

We're really proud of our toolchain, as it avoids an array problems that developers deal with on a
day to day basis, primarily around running tasks using the wrong version of Node.js or their chosen
package manager. While we're in the process of supporting additional languages, starting with
[Deno](https://deno.land/), we had an idea... Since this is basically a better "version manager for
tools", why not extract this out into something else?

And that's what we plan to do! Before we do so, we've had to make some architectural changes, many
of which have landed in this release. During this process, we were able to implement an even better
toolchain, polish many of the edge cases, and improve performance! Stay tuned for more information
on this new tool!

## Increased output hydration by 8-10x

In moon, hydration is the concept of unpacking an existing hashed artifact into a
[task's outputs](../docs/config/project#outputs) during a cache hit. In our previous implementation,
we would delete all existing outputs before unpacking the archive to ensure a clean slate and to
avoid stale files. While this worked, it wasn't the most performant, taking about 280ms for 1,000
files (which is still reasonably fast!).

In our new implementation, we now utilize a smart file tree diffing algorithm that will only unpack
files _with different content_, and will automatically remove stale files in the process. This has
resulted in a 10x performance increase, taking about 30ms! Multiply this by many projects, the
results should be very apparent.

We hope you enjoy this improvement, as it's the first of many to come!

## Cache any and all targets

By default, all [targets](../docs/concepts/target) that produce outputs are cached and archived. For
targets that _do not_ produce outputs, like testing, linting, and typechecking, these are not
cached. This will result in slower CI times as they are continuously ran, even if nothing has
changed. However with our new [remote caching](../docs/guides/remote-cache) layer, we can skip these
from running entirely!

To achieve this, we've added a new setting to [`.moon/workspace.yml`](../docs/config/workspace)
called [`runner.archivableTargets`](../docs/config/workspace#archivabletargets). This setting
accepts a list of targets that should be archived, regardless of whether or not they produce
outputs.

For example, if we want to cache and archive testing, linting, and typechecking, we can define the
following:

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
runner:
  archivableTargets:
    - ':lint'
    - ':test'
    - ':typecheck'
```

## Path handling in generator templates

Our code generation is powered by [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app/docs/#built-ins), a templating
engine with a ton of built-in utilities. However, it does not provide utilities for file paths, and
as such, we now provide `path_join` and `path_relative` filters.

```twig
{{ some_path | path_relative(from = workspace_root) }}
```

We also now inject variables for the working directory, destination, and workspace root. This will
help with custom paths, especially within frontmatter!

## Other changes

View the
[official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/%40moonrepo%2Fcli%400.20.0) for a
full list of changes.

- Added `vcs.remoteCandidates` to `.moon/workspace.yml` to customize the remotes for git to query
  against.
- Added support for `moduleSuffixes` and `moduleDetection` in TypeScript `tsconfig.json` compiler
  options.
- YAML files will now respect the closest `.editorconfig` file.
- Refactored terminal output for bette readability.

## What's next?

Expect the following in the v0.21 release!

- An interactive dependency and project graph visualizer.
- A more performant project graph.
- More quality of life improvements for affected files.
