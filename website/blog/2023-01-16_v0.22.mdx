It's the first release of the year, and with this release, we're landing some quality of life
infrastructure and workflow improvements!

<!--truncate-->

## New action pipeline

When running targets, we generate a graph of actions to execute in order within the action runner.
An action is one of "setup toolchain", "install dependencies", "run target", so on and so forth. Our
action runner would then spawn threads for every action using the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/)
runtime. While this worked great, concurrency was entirely abstracted away from us.

To mitigate this problem, we've implemented a new system for executing actions known as the action
pipeline (or simply pipeline), which implements a dynamically scaling thread pool on top of Tokio.
This provides us with more control over concurrency, starting with the new `--concurrency` option,
which restricts the number of threads (or CPU cores).

```shell
$ moon run :build --concurrency 2
```

## Expanded hashing functionality

When we run targets in the pipeline, we hash a collection of inputs to calculate whether to continue
running or to exit early. This functionality has been extremely beneficial for optimizing the
pipeline, and so, we've expanded the hasher for other use cases. To start, the following 2 workflows
now utilize the hasher:

- When determining to auto-install dependencies (`npm install`, etc), we now hash all production,
  development, and peer dependencies from applicable manifests (`package.json`). This has resulted
  in more accurate installs, as we're no longer inadvertently installing when a non-dependency field
  is modified in a manifest. On top of this, will still take into account lockfile modified
  timestamps.
- When generating the project graph, we now hash all sources, aliases, and configuration files, to
  determine whether to load the project graph from the local cache.

## Project graph is now cached

Because of the hashing improvements above, we're now able to cache the entirety of the project graph
into local cache. Depending on how many projects are in your workspace, you may see performance
improvements on subsequent runs as we're no longer re-building the project graph over and over
everytime the `moon` binary is ran.

## Breaking changes

### Renamed events

Because of the runner -> pipeline changes above, the `runner.*` [webhook](/docs/guides/webhooks)
events were renamed to `pipeline.*`.

### Updated CLI options

Renamed the `--upstream` option to `--remote`, to better align with git terminology, and removed the
`--report` option from `moon check` and `moon run` commands. Reports are now always created.

## Other changes

View the
[official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/%40moonrepo%2Fcli%400.22.0) for a
full list of changes.

- Added Bun as a Tier 1 language (doesn't do much at the moment).
- Added a [`versionConstraint` setting](/docs/config/workspace#versionconstraint) in
  `.moon/workspace.yml` that enforces a requirement on the running moon binary.
- Updated the [`project` fields](/docs/config/project#project) in `moon.yml` to be optional,
  excluding `description`.
- Internal improvements to remote caching and artifact uploading.

## What's next?

Expect the following in the v0.23 release!

- Improved task inheritance workflow.
- Glob support in task `outputs`.
- Project-level environment variables.
