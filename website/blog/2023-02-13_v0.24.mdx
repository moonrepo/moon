## Project-level task platform

In our previous release, [v0.23](./v0.23#project-level-environment-variables), we added support for
project-level environment variables. This is great as it helps to reduce duplication for projects
with many tasks. On that note, we wondered which configuration field we could apply similar
treatment, and as such, we've added a project-level [`platform`](/docs/config/project#platform)
setting.

When this setting is defined, all task's within the current project that have _not explicitly_
configured their `platform`, will inherit the project-level platform. If neither settings are
defined, we'll attempt to detect the correct platform based on the state of the project.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
# Will set non-explicit task's platform to node
platform: 'node'

tasks:
	# Will be node
  dev: # ...

	# Will be node
  build: # ...

	# Will be system
  serve:
    # ...
    platform: 'system'
```

> This setting is _extremely useful_ for projects that contain multiple languages. Even more so once
> we land Bun and Deno support, as we'll need a way to differentiate JavaScript/TypeScript projects!

## Interactive tasks

When moon executes a task, it streams both stdout and stderr to the terminal _and_ captures the
output for later use. We do this 2 reasons:

- We store stdout.log and stderr.log files in the tarball archive.
- We replay this captured output when executing a task that has been cached.

While this works, our approach is non-standard. Streams are either piped or inherited, not both!
Because of our custom abstraction around streams and output capturing, it disrupts stdin, breaking
all interactive commands. If you tried to run a task that prompted you with a question and were
unable to answer it, this is why!

To remedy this shortcoming, we're approaching this from 2 angles. The first is all tasks marked as
[`local`](/docs/config/project#local) (or have caching disabled) will no longer capture streamed
output, and will instead stream natively, allowing interactivity out of the box. This will cover the
majority of use cases.

For the remaining use cases, we're introducing a new `--interactive` flag for
[`moon run`](/docs/commands/run). When this flag is provided, it will force the target into an
interactive mode.

```shell
$ moon run app:new --interactive
```

## Improved `moon query` commands (breaking)

The [`moon query projects`](/docs/commands/query/projects) and
[`moon query touched-files`](/docs/commands/query/touched-files) commands are useful for building
custom solutions and integrations on top of moon, but they weren't developer friendly as they output
large JSON blobs. To remedy this, we've updated both commands to output a simple human readable
format by default, and moved the JSON output behind a `--json` flag.

For example, `moon query touched-files` now outputs a list of absolute file paths separated by new
lines.

```
/moon/website/docs/commands/query/projects.mdx
/moon/crates/cli/tests/query_test.rs
/moon/crates/cli/src/commands/query.rs
/moon/website/blog/2023-02-13_v0.24.mdx
```

While `moon query projects` now outputs a list of project separated by new lines, where each line
contains the project name, source, type, and language.

```
report | packages/report | library | typescript
runtime | packages/runtime | library | typescript
types | packages/types | library | typescript
visualizer | packages/visualizer | library | typescript
website | website | application | typescript
```

We had 2 goals in mind for this change, the first was to make it easily readable, and the second was
for the default output to be easily parseable. We believe we've accomplished these goals!

## Shell completions

Auto-completion in your terminal increases productivity, which we're a massive fan of. To help
support this, we're introducing the [`moon completions`](/docs/commands/completions) command, which
generates the appropriate command completions for your current shell.

This command writes to stdout, which can then be redirected to a file of your choice. Be sure to
configure your shell profile to load the completions!

```shell
$ moon completions > ~/.bash_completion.d/moon.sh
```
