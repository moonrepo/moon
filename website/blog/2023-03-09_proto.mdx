We are proud to announce the launch of [proto](/proto), a next-generation toolchain manager for all
of your favorite programming languages.

[proto](/proto) is a Rust based multi-language toolchain manager that will download and install
tools by version, and immediately make them available on `PATH`. proto is launching with initial
support for [Bun](https://bun.sh), [Deno](https://deno.land), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (with
npm, pnpm, yarn), and [Go](https://go.dev), with more languages on the way!

```shell
proto install node 18
proto install go 1.20
proto install deno 1.30
```

Unlike other version managers that pin their global binary to a default version, proto will
[contextually detect an applicable version](/docs/proto/detection) from the environment or the
language's ecosystem (like `.nvmrc`), ensuring the correct tool is always being ran.

```shell
# Will detect a version before running
bun run ./script.ts
```

Furthermore, with proto's [`.prototools`](/docs/proto/config) file, you can pin versions of all
required tools on a per-project or per-repo basis, allowing for near instant setup of developer
environments. Perfect for onboarding new developers!

```toml title=".prototools"
node = "18.12.0"
yarn = "3.3.0"
```

```shell
# Install all the things!
proto use
```

And lastly, [moon](/moon)'s toolchain is built on proto, so if you're using moon, you might as well
use proto. This will enable a single toolchain for both tools!

## How to get started?

In a terminal that supports Bash, run:

```
curl -fsSL https://moonrepo.dev/install/proto.sh | bash
```

In Powershell or Windows Terminal, run:

```
irm https://moonrepo.dev/install/proto.ps1 | iex
```

Jump to the [documentation](/docs/proto) for more information on getting started and available
commands!

## Why another version manager?

To start, proto powers [moon's](/moon) toolchain and integrated developer environment. We believed
that moon's toolchain would be extremely beneficial for developers as a whole, and so we extracted
proto out into a standalone Rust CLI and Rust crates that moon inherits.

Furthermore, we believe that requiring multiple ad-hoc version managers for all your languages, each
with different workflows, CLI commands, and configuration files, is a poor developer experience.

Our goal is to unify all of these into a single performant interface. A toolchain manager is the
next step in the version manager evolution.
