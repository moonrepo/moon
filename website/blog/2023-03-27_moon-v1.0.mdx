ðŸŽ‰ It's finally here! After almost a year of development, a handful of breaking changes, we've
officially reached a stable v1 of moon! This release is feature packed with quality of life
improvements.

<!--truncate-->

## The road to v1

It's been 10 months since moon launched publicly, and since that time we have landed 501 pull
requests, fixed 100's of bugs, made 16 breaking changes, released 26 versions, and have been used by
companies like Ikea, SumUp, Depot, and Gallery. It's been a wild ride, and we're excited to finally
reach a stable v1 release.

## Project boundaries with constraints

One feature that moon has not supported, but is critical for large monorepos, is project boundaries.
A project boundary is a concept that enforces a strict relationship between projects, and is a
common pattern in monorepos. For example, a project may only be allowed to depend on projects with a
[specific tag](#enforce-relationships-with-tags), or a project of a specific type.

moon now supports this functionality through the new
[`constraints`](/docs/config/workspace#constraints) setting in
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](/docs/config/workspace). The primary constraint we're introducing is
[`enforceProjectTypeRelationships`](/docs/config/workspace#enforceprojecttyperelationships), which
enforces relationships between projects based on their [`type`](/docs/config/project#type) field.

For example, an application can only depend on library or tool based projects, but _not_ other
applications (this is a code smell). This setting is enabled by default!

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
constraints:
  enforceProjectTypeRelationships: true
```

And that's not all, continue reading for more information on tag based constraints!

## Project tagging

Everyone is familiar with the concept of tagging, and moon's implementation is no different. Tags
are a simple mechanism for categorizing projects, and can be defined through the
[`tags`](/docs/config/project#tags) setting in [`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tags:
  - 'react'
  - 'prisma'
```

Tags can be used to group projects together for easier querying, enforcing of project boundaries,
applying constraints, and more in the future. Tags will become a staple for maintaining repositories
at scale. Continue reading for more information!

### Querying projects by tag

The first integration with tags is project querying. You can now query for projects by tag using the
new `--tags` option in the [`moon query projects`](/docs/commands/query/projects) command. For
example, say you want to find all projects that are tagged with `vue` or `trpc`:

```shell
$ moon query projects --tags 'vue|trpc'
```

### Enforce relationships with tags

Another feature of tags is enforcing relationships between projects using our new
[`constraints`](#project-boundaries-with-constraints) setting. When a tagged constraint is defined,
it requires all [dependencies](/docs/concepts/project#dependencies) of a tagged project to require 1
of the configured tags, otherwise an error is thrown during project graph creation.

To demonstrate this, take the following configuration:

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2,3}
constraints:
  tagRelationships:
    next: ['react', 'trpc']
```

This dictates that all dependencies of a project with the `next` tag, must declare either `react`,
`trpc`, or `next` in their own tags. This is great for crafting a monorepo with strict project
boundaries!

## Shells for system tasks

Up until now, all executed tasks would not be wrapped in a shell for 1 reason, to ensure tasks are
deterministic. A major goal for moon is that tasks are deterministic and easily reproducible across
all machines. Shells break this guarantee, as they can introduce subtle bugs that are difficult to
diagnose, and may differ wildly between developers and machines.

However in practice, not supporting shells has been a major pain point for many users, and for the
most part, most system tasks typically run common commands or execute pre-defined scripts. The
chance of a non-deterministic build is very small. As such, we've decided to make a compromise, and
allow shells for [system tasks](/docs/config/project#platform-1), but not for language based tasks.

For example, the following tasks:

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  example:
    command: 'echo $PWD'
    platform: 'system'
  global:
    command: 'bin-on-path'
    platform: 'system'
```

Would now be executed as `/bin/sh -c 'echo $PWD'` and `/bin/sh -c 'bin-on-path'` on Unix platforms
respectively. On Windows, we execute tasks with `pwsh.exe -c` and pass arguments via stdin.

We're also taking this a step further, by introducing a new task option called
[`shell`](/docs/config/project#shell), that can be used to toggle the shell wrapping on or off. When
turned off, this allows you to customize and execute the shell as you please.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  example:
    command: 'bash -c "echo $PWD"'
    platform: 'system'
    options:
      shell: false
```

## Environment variable substitution

moon supports granular environment variables through the project-level
[`env`](/docs/config/project#env) setting, task-level [`env`](/docs/config/project#env-1) setting,
and the task [`envFile`](/docs/config/project#envfile) option. We're expanding their functionality
with variable substitution, allowing the value of another environment variable to be interpolated
using the syntax `${VAR_NAME}`. This is especially useful for composing complex environment
variables.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  dev:
    command: 'app start'
    env:
      APP_TARGET: '${REGION}-${ENVIRONMENT}'
```

The same substitution syntax can also be used within `.env` files.

```toml title=".env"
APP_TARGET="${REGION}-${ENVIRONMENT}"
```

## Date/time token variables

[Tokens](/docs/concepts/token) are a mechanism used in task configuration for dynamically injecting
values from the current project or task, especially when task inheritance is involved. Tokens have
existed since moon's inception, without much change... until now.

We're excited to introduce a new set of tokens for referencing the
[current date or time](/docs/concepts/token#datetime): `$date`, `$time`, `$datetime`, and
`$timestamp`. With these new tokens, you're now able to implement clever or unusual solutions, like
grouping builds or deploys based on the current timestamp.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  deploy:
    command: 'app deploy --output ./build/$timestamp'
```
