In this release we focused primarily on remote caching and toolchain improvements.

## Alpha release of toolchain WASM plugins

### TypeScript toolchain

## Experimental `moonx` executable

## Dynamic JSON schemas

With the initial support for toolchain plugins, the available configuration in
[`.moon/toolchain.yml`](/docs/config/toolchain) and [`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project) is no longer
static, and is instead dynamic based on the enabled/configured toolchains. Because of this, the JSON
schemas provided at `moonrepo.dev` and in the GitHub release are not accurate for some toolchain
related settings, but accurate for everything else.

This may lead to a poor developer experience where your editor shows errors for unknown settings. To
remedy this, we now generate dynamic schemas at `.moon/cache/schemas` with accurate settings. If
you're editor supports the `$schema` property, you can update them like so:

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
$schema: './cache/schemas/toolchain.json'
```

```yaml title="app/moon.yml"
$schema: '../.moon/cache/schemas/toolchain.json'
```

These schemas are automatically generated through [`moon run`](/docs/commands/run) but can be
manually generated with [`moon sync config-schemas`](/docs/commands/sync/config-schemas).

:::info

Our official VS Code extension and the VS Code YAML server does not support the
[`$schema` property](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server/pull/970), but there
is a
[work around](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server?tab=readme-ov-file#using-inlined-schema).
We're looking into ways of solving this on our end.

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.33.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added support for `moon run ~:build`, which will run the `build` task in the closest project
  (traversing upwards).
- Added `$XDG_DATA_HOME` support when detecting the moon store. Will be used if `$MOON_HOME` is not
  set, and will fallback to `$HOME/.moon`.
- Added elapsed/timing information to child processes and WASM calls within logs.
- Improved the handling of CTRL-C, CTRL-BREAK, and other signals on Windows.
- Updated `moon init` with toolchain plugin support.
- Updated `toolchain.default` in `moon.yml` to support a list of IDs.
- Updated file hashing (via `git hash-object`) to continously pipe stdin to avoid hanging processes.
