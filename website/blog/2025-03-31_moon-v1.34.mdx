With this release, we're introducing a handful of performance and customization improvements!

<!--truncate-->

## moonbase has been sunset

As mentioned in previous releases, we have sunset [moonbase](/moonbase), our remote caching service.
A while back we had internal discussions on whether to rework moonbase so that it could be
self-hosted (on-premises), or adopt the
[Bazel Remote Execution API](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis) and utilize what the open
source community has to offer. We ultimately decided with the latter, as it frees up resources on
our end to focus on moon and proto, and also provides a better path forward for moon adoption.

If you are currently using moonbase, we suggest migrating to our new
[remote caching options](/docs/guides/remote-cache). And if you have an active moonbase
subscription, it will be cancelled within the week, and any partial billing for this month will be
reimbursed.

## Customize actions in the pipeline

When a task is ran in moon, we create an [action graph](/docs/how-it-works/action-graph) (not a task
graph) of actions, which are operations required to run to ensure a successful execution. This
includes non-task related functionality, like project and workspace syncing, installing
dependencies, and ensuring the toolchain has been setup. While these actions only take milliseconds
to execute (on a cache hit), they can become quite a barrier and source of friction (on cache miss).

Until now, there wasn't anyway to disable/skip these extra actions -- besides some non-documented
environment variables that didn't actually omit the actions (they were still in the graph), but
simply skipped the inner execution. In this release, we're introducing 4 new settings for
[`pipeline`](/docs/config/workspace#pipeline) (formerly `runner`) in
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](/docs/config/workspace).

- `installDependencies` setting toggles the inclusion of the `InstallWorkspaceDeps` and
  `InstallProjectDeps` actions, and can be scoped to toolchain IDs.
- `syncProjects` setting toggles the inclusion of the `SyncProject` actions, and can be scoped to
  project IDs.
- `syncProjectDependencies` setting toggles whether to recursively create `SyncProject` actions for
  each dependency of a project, or just for itself.
- `syncWorkspace` setting toggles the inclusion of the root `SyncWorkspace` action.

For example, if you want to disable all of these actions entirely, you can do this:

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
pipeline:
  installDependencies: false
  syncProjects: false
  syncProjectDependencies: false
  syncWorkspace: false
```

And as mentioned above, the `installDependencies` and `syncProjects` settings support configuring a
list of IDs, which acts as an allow list. Any IDs not listed here will not create actions.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
pipeline:
  # Only install Node.js dependencies
  installDependencies: ['node']
  # Only sync the `app` project
  syncProjects: ['app']
```

:::info

Even if you disable actions with the `pipeline` setting, the [`moon sync`](/docs/commands/sync)
commands can still be used to run sync operations, as they ignore that setting. This provides a
solution where you want to avoid the overhead when running a task, but still take advantage of
moon's syncing to ensure a healthy repository state.

### New `--no-actions` flag

To expand upon the above, we're introducing a `--no-actions` flag to
[`moon run`](/docs/commands/run), that will run the task without the other actions being added to
the graph. We suggest only using this flag once dependencies have been installed, and the toolchain
has been setup!

```shell
$ moon run app:start --no-actions
```

## New experiments

It's been a while since we've added new experiments, and in this release, we've got 2! We encourage
everyone to enable these experiments to ensure they are working correctly, but do note that these
are a work in progress and may be buggy.

### Faster glob walking

We've been monitoring glob performance for sometime now, as walking the filesystem has been one of
the largest bottlenecks, especially in large codebases. We felt it was about time to tackle the
problem.

With this new implementation, we are doing a few things to increase performance. To start, we are
parallelizing walking per directory, where previously this would happen serially. Next, we partition
globs based on a common ancestor directory, which reduces the amount of unnecessary walking. And
lastly, we cache common globs to avoid walking all together.

In our benchmarks and tests (moon itself is already using it), we are seeing performance increases
by 1.5-2x! To start using this new glob implementation, enable the new `fasterGlobWalk` experiment.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
experiments:
  fasterGlobWalk: true
```

### Better Git integration

Our current Git integration works, assuming you're not doing anything complex, like using submodules
or worktrees. If you are using the latter, things have been buggy. We're not happy about this, as we
want to support all the different ways a repository can be architected.

So we started over from scratch! We even created
[real repositories](https://github.com/moonrepo/git-test) to ensure our understanding and
implementation of these features is accurate. This new implementation achieves the following:

- Supports submodules, subtrees, and worktees (unique among build systems).
  - Our competitors don't support these, and we expect them to "borrow" our implementation in the
    future (like they have with other features).
- Git commands are parallelized when applicable.
- Touched files within submodules are now properly extracted.
- File discovery and hashing is more performant.

If you'd like to try this new Git implementation (moon itself already is), enable the `gitV2`
experiment.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
experiments:
  gitV2: true
```

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.34.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added a `--json` flag to `moon templates`.
- Integrated a new console rendering system with new terminal styles, prompts, and output.
- Improved the performance of environment variable substitution.
- Improved toolchain plugin loading to be on-demand.
- Improved sync cache invalidation for codeowners, config schemas, and VCS hooks.

## What's next?

Going forward, we plan to release new updates on a bi-weekly schedule, instead of a monthly
schedule. This will result in less features each release, but will reduce the burden and complexity
of large releases. With that said, this is what we have tentatively planned for the next release!

- Migrate the Rust toolchain to a WASM plugin.
- Investigate a new args/command line parser.
- Add Poetry support for the Python toolchain.
