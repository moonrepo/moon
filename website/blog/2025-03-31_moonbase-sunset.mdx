As mentioned in previous moon releases and announcements, we have sunset [moonbase](/moonbase), our
remote caching service.

<!-- truncate -->

A while back we had internal discussions on whether to rework moonbase so that it could be
self-hosted (on-premises), or adopt the
[Bazel Remote Execution API](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis) and utilize what the open
source community has to offer. We ultimately decided with the latter, as it frees up resources on
our end to focus on moon and proto, and also provides a better path forward for moon adoption.

If you are currently using moonbase, we suggest migrating to our new
[remote caching options](/docs/guides/remote-cache). And if you have an active moonbase
subscription, it will be cancelled within the week, and any partial billing for this month will be
prorated.

With that said, we have some ideas brewing on how to bring this back in another form. Perhaps our
own implementation of the Bazel Remote Execution API that can be self-hosted and deeply integrate
with moon.
