With this release, we're taking yet another step to supporting plugins.

## Improved action graph

For this release we wanted to introduce a new WASM based Rust toolchain, but we encountered a few
blockers while integrating with the action graph, so instead of working on the toolchain, we decided
to rewrite the action graph to properly support plugins.

The biggest blocker was around locating the toolchain's dependency root, and in Rust's case, the
Cargo workspace (where `Cargo.lock` is located). We technically have some of this logic in the
current Rust platform, but it always assumed that the Cargo workspace was in the root of the moon
workspace (the same applies to Bun and Node). This heavily restricted all moon users. With the new
plugin system, the dependency root can be located anywhere in the moon workspace, and we'll attempt
to locate it!

While rewriting the action graph, we made a ton of improvements (some won't be noticeable until
plugins are more prevalent). To start the graph is now async compatible, and in the future, we'll
update it to also support concurrency, so that the graph can be built in parallel across threads.
Additionally, a main focus was reducing the amount of edges (relationships) being created between
nodes (actions). And lastly, the following changes were made for the actions themselves.

- Added a new `InstallDependencies` action for WASM plugins.
  - The dependencies root is now dynamically located by traversing the file system, unlike the
    previous implementation that assumed everything was in the workspace root.
- Added a new `SetupEnvironment` action for WASM plugins.
  - This runs after `SetupToolchain` but before `InstallDependencies`.
  - Can be used to setup the workspace or project environment. For example, initializing Python
    venv, or making manifest/lockfile changes.
- Updated `RunTask` to setup toolchains and install dependencies for each `toolchain` that has been
  configured, instead of just the 1st one (work in progress).
- Updated `SyncProject` to no longer depend on `SetupToolchain`, and not be grouped by
  language/toolchain, and instead encompass all of them applicable to the project.

## Task priorities

Based on a request from the community that we really liked, we're introducing a new concept called
task priorities. Each task can configure a priority level using the new task option
[`priority`](/docs/config/project#priority), and the priority level determines the position of the
task within the action pipeline queue. A task with a higher priority will run sooner rather than
later, while still respecting the topological order.

```yaml title="app/moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  build:
    # ...
    options:
      priority: 'high'
```

There are a few things to be aware of with this implementation:

- All non-task related actions (like setup toolchain) will still always run first.
- Higher priority tasks that depend on lower priority tasks will effectively mark them as high
  priority, as we attempt to complete them sooner.
- The order within each priority level is sorted topological, but is still non-deterministic if
  tasks run in parallel.

## Enabled experiments

In our last release, we introduced [2 new experiments](./moon-v1.34#new-experiments),
`fasterGlobWalk` and `gitV2`. In the past few weeks, we've had many users (including ourself) enable
these experiments without issue. As such, we've decided to enable them by default in this release.

If you encounter an issue with either of these experiments, you can disable them in
`.moon/workspace.yml`. And of course, please report it so we can fix it!

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
experiments:
  fasterGlobWalk: false
  gitV2: false
```

## Light terminal theme

By default, moon assumes a dark themed terminal is being used, and will output our branded colors
accordingly. However, if you use a light theme, these colors are hard to read, and there's no way to
change them.

To mitigate this, we're introducing a light based terminal theme, which can be enabled with the
`--theme` global option, or the `MOON_THEME` environment variable.

```shell
$ moon run app:build --theme light
# Or
$ MOON_THEME=light moon run app:build
```

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.35.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added a new task option, `cacheKey`, which can be used to seed the hash, and invalidate local and
  remote caches.
- Added a `--log=verbose` level, which includes span information on top of the trace level.
- Added 2 new webhooks, `toolchain.installing` and `toolchain.installed`, which emit when a
  toolchain WASM plugin is installing a tool (via proto).

## What's next?

Now that are action graph supports plugins, we can take the next step in migrating an existing
platform into a toolchain.

- Migrate the Rust toolchain to a WASM plugin.
- Investigate a new args/command line parser.
- Add Poetry support for the Python toolchain.
