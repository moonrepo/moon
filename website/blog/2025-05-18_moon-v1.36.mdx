## Beta release of toolchain WASM plugins

Two months ago we announced [alpha toolchain plugins](./moon-v1.33) with support for tier 3, but not
tier 2. The reason for this was that tier 3 is powered by [proto APIs](/docs/proto/wasm-plugin),
which already existed! We simply hooked them up to moon. The bulk of the remaining plugin work was
tier 2 support, which we are excited to announce has been completed! The following APIs have been
implemented:

- `extend_project_graph` - Extend projects with toolchain specific info.
- `extend_task_command` - Extend the command child process with parameters.
- `extend_task_script` - Extend the script child process with parameters.
- `locate_dependencies_root` - Locate the package dependencies workspace root.
- `parse_manifest` - Parse a manifest file to extract dependencies.
- `parse_lock` - Parse a lock file to extract resolved dependencies.

As of this release, all 27 APIs have been implemented, and toolchain plugins are now available for
general use! However, they are still quite unstable, not fully tested, and the APIs may change
between releases, but you can start using them today!

With all this said, we do not have documentation yet. We plan to slowly work on this across the next
few releases. In the meantime, check out the following resources for more information:

- [`moon_pdk`](https://docs.rs/moon_pdk/) - Rust plugin development kit.
- Existing [toolchain plugins](https://github.com/moonrepo/plugins/tree/master/toolchains).
- In development [Rust toolchain](https://github.com/moonrepo/plugins/pull/48).

## Improved remote caching

## Improved code generation

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.36.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added `--host` and `--port` options to `moon action-graph`, `moon task-graph`, and
  `moon project-graph`.
- Added `--stdin` option to `moon ci` and `moon run`, which will allow touched files to be passed
  via stdin, instead of running VCS commands to determine them.
- Removed the restriction around `moon.{yml,pkl}` not being allowed as a task input. However, will
  not be included when using `**/*`.

## What's next?

Now that toolchain plugins are in beta, we can take the next step in migrating an existing platform
into a toolchain.

- Migrate the Rust toolchain to a WASM plugin.
