## Beta release of toolchain WASM plugins

## Improved remote caching

## Improved code generation

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.36.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added `--host` and `--port` options to `moon action-graph`, `moon task-graph`, and
  `moon project-graph`.
- Added `--stdin` option to `moon ci` and `moon run`, which will allow touched files to be passed
  via stdin, instead of running VCS commands to determine them.
- Removed the restriction around `moon.{yml,pkl}` not being allowed as a task input. However, will
  not be included when using `**/*`.

## What's next?

Now that toolchain plugins are in beta, we can take the next step in migrating an existing platform
into a toolchain.

- Migrate the Rust toolchain to a WASM plugin.
