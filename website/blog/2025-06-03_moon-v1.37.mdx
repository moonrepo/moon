In this release, we're stoked to release another WASM toolchain plugin, and experimental MCP/AI
support!

## New Rust toolchain powered by WASM

With [toolchain plugins](./moon-v1.36) entering beta last release, it's only natural that we start
migrating the legacy toolchains into plugins. And with this release, the next one we've migrated is
the Rust toolchain! However, unlike the TypeScript toolchain, the new Rust toolchain is opt-in and
must be enabled. Simply rename `rust` to `unstable_rust` in `.moon/toolchain.yml`.

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
unstable_rust:
  version: '1.87.0'
  components: ['clippy', 'rustfmt']
  targets: ['wasm32-wasip1']
  syncToolchainConfig: true
```

Although the new Rust toolchain is a one-to-one port, the WASM APIs provide far more flexibility and
functionality than before. For example, the follow improvements and enhancements have been made:

- The Cargo workspace can now exist at any folder depth and does not need to exist at the moon
  workspace root. Additionally, because of this, we can now support multiple Cargo workspaces in the
  same moon workspace.
- Added a new `addMsrvConstraint` setting, which will sync the version as a constraint to
  `Cargo.toml` under the `workspace.package.rust-version` or `package.rust-version` fields.
- Improved the accuracy of implicit project dependencies (inferred from `Cargo.toml`).
- Improved the parsing of manifest (`Cargo.toml`) and lock (`Cargo.lock`) files. This information is
  then fed into the task hashing process.
- Improved the Docker prune implementation by preserving all binaries (inferred from
  `cargo metadata`) while deleting the `target` directory.
- Any `cargo` or `rustup` commands are now hashed and cached, and will only re-run when parameters
  change. Unlike the current toolchain, which always runs these commands.

Quite a list of improvements, and this doesn't even include all the WASM / plugin improvements that
have been slowly introduced! Give this new toolchain a try, and let us know what you think!

## MCP editor integration

AI is all the rage these days, and even more so lately with the introduction of
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (model context protocol) and agentic workflows. MCP is a new
way for AI assistants to "understand" what's going on in your project without you having to explain
everything. It works by feeding structured information, like in the context of moon, projects,
tasks, and relationships, directly into AI models like GitHub Copilot or Cursor.

No more tedious explanations required! The AI can jump straight to helpful suggestions that actually
work in your codebase, saving you time, and making the whole experience much smoother, especially in
complex monorepos with lots of moving parts.

To support agentic workflows, we're introducing an experimental [`moon mcp`](/docs/commands/mcp)
command, that starts an MCP server, and can be [integrated into your editor](/docs/guides/mcp). For
example, VS Code:

```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
{
  "servers": {
    "moon": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "moon",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Our MCP server currently supports the following tools. We'll be adding more tools in the future, so
if you have any suggestions, please let us know!

- `get_project` - Get a project and its tasks by `id`.
- `get_projects` - Get all projects.
- `get_task` - Get a task by `target`.
- `get_tasks` - Get all tasks.

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.37.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added `environment.initializing` and `environment.initialized` webhook events.
- Added `root` and `toolchain` fields to `dependencies.installing` and `dependencies.installed`
  webhook events.
- Updated proto to [v0.49.4](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.49.4) (from 0.49.1).

## What's next?

With toolchains plugins being stabilized more, we'd like to focus on some other areas.

- Better command line argument parsing/joining (especially for task `args`)
- Better child process I/O piping
- Terminal notifications
- WASM toolchain documentation

### Go & JavaScript WASM toolchains

Now that the Rust toolchain has been ported to WASM, we'd like to start porting the other
toolchains, starting with Go and JavaScript (not Bun or Node.js). If you're interested in
contributing these toolchains, please ping us in Discord!

The only requirements is that these toolchains must be written in Rust and must exist in the
[moonrepo/plugins](https://github.com/moonrepo/plugins) repository!
