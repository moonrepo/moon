In this release, we're stoked to release our first WASM toolchain plugin, and experimental MCP/AI
support!

## New Rust toolchain powered by WASM

## MCP editor integration

AI is all the rage these days, and even more so lately with the introduction of
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (model context protocol) and agentic workflows. MCP is a new
way for AI assistants to "understand" what's going on in your project without you having to explain
everything. It works by feeding structured information, like in the context of moon, projects,
tasks, and relationships, directly into AI models like GitHub Copilot or Cursor.

No more tedious explanations required! The AI can jump straight to helpful suggestions that actually
work in your codebase, saving you time, and making the whole experience much smoother, especially in
complex monorepos with lots of moving parts.

To support agentic workflows, we're introducing an experimental [`moon mcp`](/docs/commands/mcp)
command, that starts an MCP server, and can be [integrated into your editor](/docs/guides/mcp). For
example, VS Code:

```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
{
  "servers": {
    "moon": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "moon",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Our MCP server currently supports the following tools. We'll be adding more tools in the future, so
if you have any suggestions, please let us know!

- `get_project` - Get a project and its tasks by `id`.
- `get_projects` - Get all projects.
- `get_task` - Get a task by `target`.
- `get_tasks` - Get all tasks.

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.37.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added `environment.initializing` and `environment.initialized` webhook events.
- Added `root` and `toolchain` fields to `dependencies.installing` and `dependencies.installed`
  webhook events.
- Updated proto to [v0.49.4](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.49.4) (from 0.49.1).

## What's next?

With toolchains plugins being stabilized more, we'd like to focus on some other areas.

- Better command line argument parsing/joining (especially for task `args`)
- Better child process I/O piping
- Terminal notifications
- WASM toolchain documentation

### Go & JavaScript WASM toolchains

Now that the Rust toolchain has been ported to WASM, we'd like to start porting the other
toolchains, starting with Go and JavaScript (not Bun or Node.js). If you're interested in
contributing these toolchains, please ping us in Discord!

The only requirements is that these toolchains must be written in Rust and must exist in the
[moonrepo/plugins](https://github.com/moonrepo/plugins) repository!
