In this release, we're stoked to release another WASM toolchain plugin, and experimental MCP/AI
support!

## New Go toolchain powered by WASM

Official Go toolchain support has been requested by the community for a long time now, and with the
somewhat stabilization of WASM plugins and the introduction of the
[Rust toolchain in the last release](./moon-v1.37), we felt it was finally time to add Go! To enable
Go, run the following command or add an [`unstable_go`](/docs/config/toolchain#unstable_go) entry to
`.moon/toolchain.yml`.

```shell
$ moon init unstable_go
```

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
unstable_go:
  version: '1.24.0'
  workspaces: true
```

The Go toolchain releases with full [tier 1, 2, and 3 support](/docs/how-it-works/languages)!
Additionally, the following features and functionality is available when enabling the toolchain:

- Supports Go workspaces through the `go.work` file. Can be disabled with the
  `unstable_go.workspaces` setting.
- Extracts the `go.mod` `module` directive as a project alias.
- Extracts project relationships and dependency information from `go.mod` `require` directives.
- Extracts version and checksum information from `go.sum` and `go.work.sum` files.
- Injects Go globals directory (`GOBIN`) into task command/script child processes.
- Supports installing Go globals via `go install` commands. Can be customized with the
  `unstable_go.bins` setting.
- Automatically runs `go mod` or `go work` commands when installing dependencies.
- Basic Docker image and pruning support.

We hope you enjoy this new Go toolchain. With that said, we are not Go experts, and would love to
hear from you on what works, what doesn't, what can be improved, and what features you would like to
see added!

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.38.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added a `notifier.webhookAcknowledge` setting, that ensures webhooks resolve with a 2XX status
  code.
- Updated proto to [v0.50.1](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.50.0) (from 0.49.4).

## What's next?

With toolchains plugins being stabilized more, we'd like to focus on some other areas.

- Better command line argument parsing/joining (especially for task `args`)
- Better child process I/O piping
- WASM toolchain documentation
