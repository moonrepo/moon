## v2 in the works!

We've been talking about v2 for many years now, and with the near stabilization of toolchain WASM
plugins, we're ready to pull the trigger! So what does this mean exactly?

We'd like to land v2 at the start of the new year, and to hit this milestone, we'll be focusing all
our efforts on this initiative and _will not_ be releasing any new features or improvements to the
v1 line until v2 is released. This does not include bug fixes or security patches, which we will
continue to provide as needed.

So what should you expect in v2?

- Toolchain WASM plugins stabilized, with the old platform system removed.
- Extension WASM plugins can extend the project graph and tasks.
- Remote cache powered by Bazel Remote Execution API stabilized.
- Task inheritance via inline configuration.
- Task inheritance deep merging/extending (is shallow right now).
- Default project when running tasks.
- Renamed and improved configuration settings.
- New binary release strategy.
- Improved CLI commands.
- [And much more!](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/issues/1681)

If you have any requests for v2, please leave a comment in the PR linked above! Additionally, if
you'd like to help with v2, let us know!

## New Deno toolchain powered by WASM

TODO

## New task inputs

In [v1.39](./moon-v1.39) we introduced new formats for task inputs, a URI string format and an
object format, based on this [RFC](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/issues/1985). However, we only
implemented support for files and globs. In this release, we have added support for more input
types.

### File groups

Similar to the existing file group tokens (`@files`, `@dirs`, etc), we are introducing a new
[file group input type](/docs/config/project#file-groups), with support for `group://` URIs and
`group` objects.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
fileGroups:
  sources:
    - 'src/**/*'

tasks:
  build:
    # ...
    inputs:
      # Using group protocol
      - 'group://sources?format=dirs'
      # Using an object
      - group: 'sources'
        format: 'dirs'
```

### External projects

This feature has been highly requested, but we were unsure how to best implement it... until now.
With the new external project input type, you can now rely on arbitrary files from other projects as
inputs, instead of requiring no-op or intermediate task relationships. This is perfect for "I want
any file change in a project dependency to trigger a rebuild" scenarios.

This input type supports both `project://` URIs and `project` objects. Both of which require a
project identifier, or `^` to inherit all project dependencies (similar to targets).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  example:
    inputs:
      # Using project protocol
      - 'project://foo'
      # Using an object
      - project: 'foo'
```

By default this will include all files in the target project, using `**/*`, but this can be
customized with explicit globs, or referencing a file group in the target project.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  example:
    inputs:
      - 'project://foo?filter=src/**/*'
      - project: 'foo'
        group: 'sources'
```

## Improved task outputs

In the spirit of the new task inputs, we have also improved task outputs by applying the same
formats treatment! All file and glob outputs now support the URI and object formats.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  example:
    outputs:
      # Literal
      - 'dist/**/*'
      # Using glob protocol
      - 'glob://dist/**/*'
      # Using an object
      - glob: 'dist/**/*'
```

Additionally, file based outputs now support an `optional` parameter, which will avoid throwing an
error if the output does not exist after a task has ran. This has also been a much requested
feature!

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  example:
    outputs:
      - 'file://build/artifact?optional'
      - file: 'build/artifact'
        optional: true
```

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.41.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added new values to the `runInCI` task option:
  - `only` - Only run the task in CI, and not locally, when affected.
  - `skip` - Skip running in CI but run locally and allow task relationships to be valid.
