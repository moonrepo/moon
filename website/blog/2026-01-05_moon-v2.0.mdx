## Projects

### Multiple aliases

In addition to identifiers, projects also support aliases, which are toolchain specific names
derived from manifest files, for example, the `name` field in `package.json` or `Cargo.toml`. This
allows you to refer to projects by their native names on the command line, in configuration, and
more.

Previously, projects only supported a single alias, but now they support multiple aliases, one from
each applicable toolchain. In addition, we have added a new `$projectAliases` token, which is a
comma-separated list of all aliases. The existing `$projectAlias` token now returns the first alias,
if it exists.
