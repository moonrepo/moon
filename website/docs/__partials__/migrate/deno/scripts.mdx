Deno provides a built-in task runner through the
[`deno task` command](https://deno.land/manual@v1.31.1/tools/task_runner). While Deno tasks are
great, they're not as efficient as moon. They _do not_ support granular inputs, smart hashing,
incremental caching, and all the other performance benefits that moon provides.

With that being said, you _do not_ have to migrate away from Deno tasks. Instead, you can simply run
them from within moon tasks. This gives you the best of both worlds.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
language: 'typescript'

tasks:
	analyze:
		command: 'deno task analyze'
		inputs:
			- '@globs(sources)'
			- '@globs(tests)'
			- 'Rakefile'
```

> When Deno tasks are ran through moon tasks, the current working directory is set to the project
> root.
