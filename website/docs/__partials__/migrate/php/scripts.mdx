The PHP ecosystem has standardized (somewhat) around
[Composer scripts](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md#writing-custom-commands) for
reusability. While these work, they're not as efficient as moon. They _do not_ support granular
inputs, smart hashing, incremental caching, and all the other performance benefits that moon
provides.

With that being said, you _do not_ have to migrate away from Composer. Instead, you can simply run
these scripts from within moon tasks. This gives you the best of both worlds.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
language: 'php'

tasks:
	test:
		command: 'php composer.phar run-script test'
		inputs:
			- '@globs(sources)'
			- '@globs(tests)'
			- 'composer.json'
```

In the future, we aim to infer these scripts automatically, and provide migration scripts.
