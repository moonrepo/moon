The Python ecosystem has support for many task runners such as [doit](https://pydoit.org/) and
[pypyr](https://pypyr.io/). While these are great, they're not as efficient as moon. They _do not_
support granular inputs, smart hashing, incremental caching, and all the other performance benefits
that moon provides.

With that being said, you _do not_ have to migrate away from these tools. Instead, you can simply
run their commands from within moon tasks. This gives you the best of both worlds.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
language: 'python'

tasks:
	test:
		command: 'doit test'
		inputs:
			- '@globs(sources)'
			- '@globs(tests)'
			- 'pyproject.toml'
```
