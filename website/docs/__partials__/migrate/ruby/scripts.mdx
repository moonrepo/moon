The Ruby ecosystem has standardized around the task runner [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/),
which is a Makefile like system written in Ruby. While Rake is great and it accomplishes everything
it set out to do, it's not as efficient as moon. It _does not_ support granular inputs, smart
hashing, incremental caching, and all the other performance benefits that moon provides.

With that being said, you _do not_ have to migrate away from Rake. Instead, you can simply run Rake
commands from within moon tasks. This gives you the best of both worlds.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
language: 'ruby'

tasks:
	test:
		command: 'rake test'
		inputs:
			- '@globs(sources)'
			- '@globs(tests)'
			- 'Rakefile'
```
