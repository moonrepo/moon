tool has not been configured or installed, this will return a 1 or 2 exit code with no value
respectively.

/Users/example/.moon/tools/node/x.x.x/bin/node
```

> A tool is considered "not configured" when not in use, for example, querying yarn/pnpm when the
> package manager is configured for "npm". A tool is considered "not installed", when it has not
> been downloaded and installed into the tools directory.
