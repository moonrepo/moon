The `moon docker setup` command will efficiently install dependencies for focused projects. This is
an all-in-one command for all dependency installations, and should replace `npm install` and other
commands.

```shell
$ moon docker setup
```

:::caution

This command _must be_ ran after [`moon docker scaffold`](./scaffold) and is typically ran within a
`Dockerfile`!
