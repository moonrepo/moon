The `moon exec` (or `moon x`, or `moonx`) command is a low-level command for executing tasks in the
action pipeline. It provides fine-grained control over how tasks are selected and executed, through
command line options, making it ideal for custom workflows and advanced use cases.

The [`moon check`](./check), [`moon ci`](./ci), and [`moon run`](./run) commands are all built on
top of `moon exec`, so be sure to check those out for more user-friendly abstractions!

```shell
# Run `lint` in project `app`
$ moon exec app:lint
$ moonx app:lint

# Run `dev` in project `client` and `server`
$ moon exec client:dev server:dev
$ moonx client:dev server:dev

# Run `test` in all projects
$ moon exec :test
$ moonx :test

# Run `test` in all projects with tag `frontend`
$ moon exec '#frontend:test'
$ moonx '#frontend:test'

# Run `format` in the default project
$ moon exec format
$ moonx format

# Run `build` in projects matching the query
$ moon exec :build --query "language=javascript && projectLayer=library"
```

## Arguments

- `...<target>` - [Targets](../concepts/target) or project relative tasks to run.
- `[-- <args>]` - Additional arguments to
  [pass to the underlying command](../run-task#passing-arguments-to-the-underlying-command).

## Options

- `-f`, `--force` - Force run and bypass cache, ignore changed files, and skip affected checks.
- `-i`, `--interactive` - Run the pipeline and tasks interactively.
- `-s`, `--summary [LEVEL]` - Print a summary of all actions that were ran in the pipeline.

### Workflow

- `--on-failure <ON>` - When a task fails, either bail the pipeline, or continue executing.
- `--only-ci-tasks` - Filter tasks to those that only run in CI.
- `--query <QUERY>` - Filter tasks based on the result of a query.
- `--no-actions` - Run the pipeline without sync and setup related actions.

### Affected

- `--affected [BY]` - Only run tasks if affected by changed files. Optionally accepts "local" or
  "remote".
- `--base <BASE>` - Base branch, commit, or revision to compare against.
- `--head <HEAD>` - Current branch, commit, or revision to compare with.
- `--status <STATUS>` - Filter changed files based on a changed status.
- `--stdin` - Accept changed files from stdin for affected checks.

### Graph

- `--downstream <DEPTH>`, `--dependents <DEPTH>` - Control the depth of downstream dependents.
- `--upstream <DEPTH>`, `--dependencies <DEPTH>` - Control the depth of upstream dependencies.

### Parallelism

- `--job <INDEX>` - Index of the current job (0 based).
- `--job-total <TOTAL>` - Total amount of jobs to run.
