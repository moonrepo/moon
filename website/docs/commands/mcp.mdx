The `moon mcp` command will start an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that listens for
requests from AI assistants. This allows for agentic workflows in your favorite editor.

```shell
$ moon mcp
```

:::info

This command should not be ran manually and instead should be integrated into your editor. View the
[MCP guide](../guides/mcp) for more information.
