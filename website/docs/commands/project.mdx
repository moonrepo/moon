The `moon project <name>` command will display all available information about a project that has
been configured and exists within the graph. If a project does not exist, the program will return
with a 1 exit code.

```shell
$ moon project web
```

### Arguments

- `<name>` - Name of a project, as defined in [`projects`](../config/workspace#projects).

### Options
