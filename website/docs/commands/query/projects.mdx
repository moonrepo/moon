Use the `moon query projects` sub-command to query information about all projects in the project
graph. The project list can be filtered by passing a [query statement](../../concepts/query-lang) as
an argument, or by using [options](#options) arguments.

```shell
# Find all projects
$ moon query projects

# Find all projects with an id that matches "react"
$ moon query projects --id react
$ moon query projects "project~react"

# Find all projects with a `lint` or `build` task
$ moon query projects --tasks "lint|build"
$ moon query projects "task=[lint,build]"
```

By default, this will output a list of projects in the format of
`<id> | <source> | <stack> | <type> | <language> | <description>`, separated by new lines. If no
description is defined, "..." will be displayed instead.

```
web | apps/web | frontend | application | typescript | ...
```

The projects can also be output in JSON by passing the `--json` flag. The output has the following
structure:

```ts
{
	projects: Project[],
	options: QueryOptions,
}
```

### Affected projects

This command can also be used to query for affected projects, based on the state of the VCS working
tree. For advanced control, you can also pass the results of `moon query touched-files` to stdin.

```shell
# Find all affected projects
$ moon query projects --affected

# Find all affected projects using the results of another query
$ moon query touched-files | moon query projects --affected
```

### Arguments

#### Affected

- `--upstream` - Include upstream dependencies of queried projects. Supports "none", "direct",
  "deep" (default).
  <VersionLabel version="1.29.0" />

#### Filters

All option values are case-insensitive regex patterns.

- `--alias <regex>` - Filter projects that match this alias.
