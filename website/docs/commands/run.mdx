The `moon run` (or `moon r`, or `moonx`) command will run one or many [targets](../concepts/target)
and all of its dependencies in topological order. Each run will incrementally cache each task,
improving speed and development times... over time. View the official [Run a task](../run-task) and
[Cheat sheet](../cheat-sheet#tasks) articles for more information!

```shell
# Run `lint` in project `app`
$ moon run app:lint
$ moonx app:lint

# Run `dev` in project `client` and `server`
$ moon run client:dev server:dev
$ moonx client:dev server:dev

# Run `test` in all projects
$ moon run :test
$ moonx :test

# Run `test` in all projects with tag `frontend`
$ moon run '#frontend:test'
$ moonx '#frontend:test'

# Run `format` in closest project (`client`)
$ cd apps/client
$ moon run format
$ moonx format

# Run `build` in projects matching the query
$ moon run :build --query "language=javascript && projectType=library"
```

:::info

How affected status is determined is highly dependent on whether the command is running locally, in
CI, and what options are provided. The following scenarios are possible:

- When `--affected` is provided, will explicitly use `--remote` to determine CI or local.
- When not provided, will use `git diff` in CI, or `git status` for local.
- To bypass affected logic entirely, use `--force`.

:::

:::info

The default behavior for `moon run` is to "fail fast", meaning that any failed task will immediately
abort execution of the entire action graph. Pass `--no-bail` to execute as many tasks as safely
possible (tasks with upstream failures will be skipped to avoid side effects). This is the default
behavior for `moon ci`, and is also useful for pre-commit hooks.

### Arguments

- `...<target>` - [Targets](../concepts/target) or project relative tasks to run.
- `[-- <args>]` - Additional arguments to
  [pass to the underlying command](../run-task#passing-arguments-to-the-underlying-command).

### Options

- `-f`, `--force` - Force run and ignore touched files and affected status. Will not query VCS.
- `--dependents` - Run downstream dependent targets (of the same task name) as well.
- `-i`, `--interactive` - Run the target in an interactive mode.
- `--profile <type>` - Record and [generate a profile](../guides/profile) for ran tasks.
  - Types: `cpu`, `heap`
- `--query` - Filter projects to run targets against using
  [a query statement](../concepts/query-lang). <VersionLabel version="1.3.0" />
- `--summary` - Display a summary and stats of the current run. <VersionLabel version="1.25.0" />
- `-u`, `--updateCache` - Bypass cache and force update any existing items.
- `--no-actions` - Run the task without running [other actions](../how-it-works/action-graph) in the
  pipeline.
  <VersionLabel version="1.34.0" />
- `-n`, `--no-bail` - When a task fails, continue executing other tasks instead of aborting
  immediately

#### Affected

- `--affected` - Only run target if affected by changed files, _otherwise_ will always run.
- `--remote` - Determine affected against remote by comparing `HEAD` against a base revision
  (default branch), _otherwise_ uses local changes.
  - Can control revisions with `MOON_BASE` and `MOON_HEAD`.
- `--status <type>` - Filter affected based on a change status. Can be passed multiple times.
  - Types: `all` (default), `added`, `deleted`, `modified`, `staged`, `unstaged`, `untracked`

### Configuration

- [`projects`](../config/workspace#projects) in `.moon/workspace.yml`
- [`tasks`](../config/tasks#tasks) in `.moon/tasks.yml`
- [`tasks`](../config/project#tasks) in `moon.yml`
