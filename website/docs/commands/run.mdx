title: run
---

The `moon run` (or `moon r`) command will run one or many [targets](../concepts/target) (a task
within a project) and all of its dependencies in topological order. Each run will incrementally
cache each task, improving speed and development times... over time.

```shell
# Run `lint` in project `app`
$ moon run app:lint

# Run `lint` in project `app` and `server`
$ moon run app:lint server:lint

# Run `lint` in all projects
$ moon run :lint
```

### Arguments

- `...<target>` - [Targets](../concepts/target) to run.
- `[-- <args>]` - Additional arguments to
  [pass to the underlying command](../run-task#passing-arguments-to-the-underlying-command).

### Options

- `--dependents` - Run downstream dependent targets (of the same task name) as well.
- `--profile <type>` - Record and [generate a profile](../guides/profile) for ran tasks.
  - Types: `cpu`, `heap`
- `--report` - Generate a report of the ran actions. Report is written to
  `.moon/cache/runReport.json`.
- `-u`, `--updateCache` - Bypass cache and force update any existing items.

#### Affected

- `--affected` - Only run target if affected by changed files, _otherwise_ will always run.
- `--status <type>` - Filter affected based on a change status. Can be passed multiple times.
  - Types: `all` (default), `added`, `deleted`, `modified`, `staged`, `unstaged`, `untracked`
- `--upstream` - Determine affected against upstream by comparing `HEAD` against a base revision
  (default branch), _otherwise_ uses local changes.
