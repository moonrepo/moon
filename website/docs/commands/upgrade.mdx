title: upgrade

The `moon upgrade` command can be used to upgrade your current moon binary (if installed globally)
to the latest version.

```shell
$ moon upgrade
```

:::caution

This command will only work if moon was installed in the `~/.moon` directory, using our official
[installation script](../install). If installed through Homebrew or Node.js, you'll need to upgrade
manually.
