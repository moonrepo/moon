## Globs

Globs in moon are [Rust-based globs](https://github.com/olson-sean-k/wax), _not_ JavaScript-based.
This may result in different or unexpected results. The following guidelines must be met when using
globs:

- Must use forward slashes (`/`) for path separators, even on Windows.
- Must _not_ start with or use any relative path parts, `.` or `..`.

### Supported syntax

- `*` - Matches zero or more characters, but does not match the `/` character. Will attempt to match
  the longest possible text (eager).
- `$` - Like `*`, but will attempt to match the shortest possible text (lazy).
- `**` - Matches zero or more directories.
- `?` - Matches exactly one character, but not `/`.
- `[abc]` - Matches one case-sensitive character listed in the brackets.
- `[!xyz]` - Like the above, but will match any character _not_ listed.
- `[a-z]` - Matches one case-sensitive character in range in the brackets.
- `[!x-z]` - Like the above, but will match any character _not_ in range.
- `{glob,glob}` - Matches one or more comma separated list of sub-glob patterns.
- `<glob:#>` - Matches a sub-glob within a defined bounds (represented by `#`).
- `!` - At the start of a pattern, will negate previous positive patterns.

> The biggest difference between JavaScript and Rust globs is `?`. In JavaScript, this marks the
> preceding character as optional, while in Rust it matches exactly 1 character.

### Examples

```bash
README.{md,mdx,txt}
src/**/*
tests/**/*.?js
!**/__tests__/**/*
logs/<[0-9]:4>-<[0-9]:2>-<[0-9]:2>.log
```

## Project relative

When configuring [`fileGroups`](../config/project#filegroups), [`inputs`](../config/project#inputs),
and [`outputs`](../config/project#outputs), all listed file paths and globs are relative from the
project root they will be ran in. They _must not_ start with `./`, or traverse upwards with `..`.

```bash
# Valid
src/**/*
package.json

# Invalid
./src/**/*
../utils
```

## Workspace relative

When configuring [`fileGroups`](../config/project#filegroups), [`inputs`](../config/project#inputs),
and [`outputs`](../config/project#outputs), a listed file path or glob can be prefixed with `/` to
resolve relative from the workspace root, and _not_ the project root.

```bash
# In project
package.json

# In workspace
/package.json
```
