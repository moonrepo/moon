title: Projects

A project is a library, application, package, binary, tool, etc, that contains source files, test
files, assets, resources, and more. A project must exist and be configured within a
[workspace](./workspace).

## Names

A project name (or identifier) is a unique resource for locating a project. The name is explicitly
configured within [`.moon/workspace.yml`](../config/workspace), as a key within the
[`projects`](../config/workspace#projects) setting, and can be written in camel/kebab/snake case.
Names support `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `_`, `-`, `/`, `.`, and must start with a character.

Names are used heavily by configuration and the command line to link and reference everything.
They're also a much easier concept for remembering projects than file system paths, and they
typically can be written with less key strokes.

Lastly, a project name can be paired with a task name to create a [target](./target).

## Aliases

Aliases are a secondary approach for naming projects, and can be used as a drop-in replacement for
standard names. What this means is that an alias can also be used when configuring dependencies, or
defining [targets](./target).

However, the difference between aliases and names is that aliases _can not_ be explicit configured
in moon. Instead, they are specific to a project's primary programming language, and are inferred
based on that context (when enabled in settings). For example, a JavaScript or TypeScript project
will use the `name` field from its `package.json` as the alias.

Because of this, a project can either be reference by its name or alias, or both. Choose the pattern
that makes the most sense for your company or team!

## Dependencies

Projects can depend on other projects within the [workspace](./workspace) to build a project graph,
and in turn, a dependency graph for executing [tasks](./task). Project dependencies are divided into
2 categories:

- **Explicit dependencies** - These are dependencies that are explicitly defined in a project's
  [`moon.yml`](../config/project) config file, using the [`dependsOn`](../config/project#dependson)
  setting. Explicit dependencies provide more built-in functionality than implicit,
  [like project syncing](../faq#what-should-be-considered-the-source-of-truth).
- **Implicit dependencies** - These are dependencies that are implicitly discovered by moon when
  scanning the repository. How an implicit dependency is discovered is based on the project's
  [`language`](../config/project#language) setting, and how that language's ecosystem functions.

## Configuration

Projects can be configured with an optional [`moon.yml`](../config/project) in the project root, or
through the optional workspace-level [`.moon/tasks.yml`](../config/tasks).
