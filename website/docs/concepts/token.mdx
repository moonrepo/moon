title: Tokens
---

import VersionLabel from '@site/src/components/Docs/VersionLabel';

Tokens are variables and functions that can be used by [`command`](../config/project#command),
[`args`](../config/project#args), [`env`](../config/project#env) (>= v1.12),
[`inputs`](../config/project#inputs), and [`outputs`](../config/project#outputs) when configuring a
task. They provide a way of accessing file group paths, referencing values from other task fields,
and referencing metadata about the project and task itself.

## Functions

A token function is labeled as such as it takes a single argument, starts with an `@`, and is
formatted as `@name(arg)`. The following token functions are available, grouped by their
functionality.

:::caution

Token functions _must_ be the only content within a value, as they expand to multiple files. When
used in an `env` value, multiple files are joined with a comma (`,`).

:::

### File groups

These functions reference file groups by name, where the name is passed as the argument.

### `@group`

> Usable in `args`, `env`, `inputs`, and `outputs`.

The `@group(file_group)` token is a standard token that will be replaced with the file group items
as-is, for both file paths and globs. This token merely exists for reusability purposes.

```yaml
fileGroups:
  storybook:
    - '.storybook/**/*'
    - 'src/**/*'
    - '**/*.stories.*'

# Configured as
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'build-storybook'
    inputs:
      - '@group(storybook)'
  start:
    command: 'start-storybook'
    inputs:
      - '@group(storybook)'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'build-storybook'
    inputs:
      - '/path/to/project/.storybook/**/*'
      - '/path/to/project/src/**/*'
  start:
    command: 'start-storybook'
    inputs:
      - '/path/to/project/.storybook/**/*'
      - '/path/to/project/src/**/*'
```

### `@dirs`

> Usable in `args`, `env`, `inputs`, and `outputs`.

The `@dirs(file_group)` token will be replaced with an expanded list of directory paths, derived
from the file group of the same name. If a glob pattern is detected within the file group, it will
aggregate all directories found.

:::warning

This token walks the file system to verify each directory exists, and filters out those that don't.
If using within `outputs`, you're better off using [`@group`](#group) instead.

:::

```yaml
fileGroups:
  lintable:
    - 'src'
    - 'tests'
    - 'scripts'
    - '*.config.js'

# Configured as
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint @dirs(lintable) --color'
    inputs:
      - '@dirs(lintable)'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  lint:
    command:
      - 'eslint'
      - 'src'
      - 'tests'
      - 'scripts'
      - '--color'
    inputs:
      - '/path/to/project/src'
      - '/path/to/project/tests'
      - '/path/to/project/scripts'
```

### `@files`

> Usable in `args`, `env`, `inputs`, and `outputs`.

The `@files(file_group)` token will be replaced with an expanded list of file paths, derived from
the file group of the same name. If a glob pattern is detected within the file group, it will
aggregate all files found.

:::warning

This token walks the file system to verify each file exists, and filters out those that don't. If
using within `outputs`, you're better off using [`@group`](#group) instead.

:::

```yaml
fileGroups:
  config:
    - '*.config.js'
    - 'package.json'

# Configured as
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack build @files(config)'
    inputs:
      - '@files(config)'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  build:
    command:
      - 'webpack'
      - 'build'
      - 'babel.config.js'
      - 'webpack.config.js'
      - 'package.json'
    inputs:
      - '/path/to/project/babel.config.js'
      - '/path/to/project/webpack.config.js'
      - '/path/to/project/package.json'
```

### `@globs`

> Usable in `args`, `env`, `inputs`, and `outputs`.

The `@globs(file_group)` token will be replaced with the list of glob patterns as-is, derived from
the file group of the same name. If a non-glob pattern is detected within the file group, it will be
ignored.

```yaml
fileGroups:
  tests:
    - 'tests/**/*'
    - '**/__tests__/**/*'

# Configured as
tasks:
  test:
    command: 'jest --testMatch @globs(tests)'
    inputs:
      - '@globs(tests)'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  test:
    command:
      - 'jest'
      - '--testMatch'
      - 'tests/**/*'
      - '**/__tests__/**/*'
    inputs:
      - '/path/to/project/tests/**/*'
      - '/path/to/project/**/__tests__/**/*'
```

### `@root`

> Usable in `args`, `env`, `inputs`, and `outputs`.

The `@root(file_group)` token will be replaced with the lowest common directory, derived from the
file group of the same name. If a glob pattern is detected within the file group, it will walk the
file system and aggregate all directories found before reducing.

```yaml
fileGroups:
  sources:
    - 'src/app'
    - 'src/packages'
    - 'src/scripts'

# Configured as
tasks:
  format:
    command: 'prettier --write @root(sources)'
    inputs:
      - '@root(sources)'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  format:
    command:
      - 'prettier'
      - '--write'
      - 'src'
    inputs:
      - '/path/to/project/src'
```

> When there's no directies, or too many directories, this function will return the project root
> using `.`.

### `@envs`<VersionLabel version="1.21.0" />

> Usable in `inputs`.

The `@envs(file_group)` token will be replaced with all environment variables that have been
configured in the group of the provided name.

```yaml
fileGroups:
  sources:
    - 'src/**/*'
    - '$NODE_ENV'

# Configured as
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'vite build'
    inputs:
      - '@envs(sources)'


# Resolves to
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'vite build'
    inputs:
      - '$NODE_ENV'
```

### Inputs & outputs

### `@in`

> Usable in `script` and `args` only.

The `@in(index)` token will be replaced with a single path, derived from
[`inputs`](../config/project#inputs) by numerical index. If a glob pattern is referenced by index,
the glob will be used as-is, instead of returning the expanded list of files.

```yaml
# Configured as
tasks:
  build:
    command:
      - 'babel'
      - '--copy-files'
      - '--config-file'
      - '@in(1)'
      - '@in(0)'
    inputs:
      - 'src'
      - 'babel.config.js'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  build:
    command:
      - 'babel'
      - '--copy-files'
      - '--config-file'
      - 'babel.config.js'
      - 'src'
    inputs:
      - '/path/to/project/src'
      - '/path/to/project/babel.config.js'
```

### `@out`

> Usable in `script` and `args` only.

The `@out(index)` token will be replaced with a single path, derived from
[`outputs`](../config/project#outputs) by numerical index.

```yaml
# Configured as
tasks:
  build:
    command:
      - 'babel'
      - '.'
      - '--out-dir'
      - '@out(0)'
    outputs:
      - 'lib'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  build:
    command:
      - 'babel'
      - '.'
      - '--out-dir'
      - 'lib'
    outputs:
      - '/path/to/project/lib'
```

### Miscellaneous

### `@meta`<VersionLabel version="1.28.0" />

> Usable in `command`, `script`, `args`, `env`, `inputs`, and `outputs` only.

The `@meta(key)` token can be used to access project metadata and will be replaced with a value
derived from [`project`](../config/project#project) in [`moon.yml`](../config/project).

The top-level fields (like `name` and `description`) will be used as-is (no quotes). If the setting
is not defined, it will default to nothing or an empty string. For lists of values, they will be
joined with `,`.

Custom metadata defined in [`project.metadata`](../config/project#metadata-1) can also be accessed
by key, but will return a JSON stringified value. For example, a custom string value of `example`
will be stringified to `"example"` (with quotes).

```yaml
project:
  name: 'example'
  metadata:
    index: 123

# Configured as
tasks:
  build:
    script: 'build --name @meta(name) --index @meta(index)'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  build:
    script: 'build --name example --index 123'
```

## Variables

A token variable is a value that starts with `$` and is substituted to a value derived from the
current workspace, project, and task. And unlike token functions, token variables can be placed
_within_ content when necessary, and supports multiple variables within the same content.

### Environment<VersionLabel version="1.30.0" />

- `$arch` - The current host architecture, derived from the Rust
  [`ARCH` constant](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/consts/constant.ARCH.html).

  [`OS` constant](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/consts/constant.OS.html).

defined, or does not have a config, the variable defaults to "unknown" (for enums) or an empty
string.
