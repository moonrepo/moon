title: Toolchain
---

The toolchain is an internal layer for downloading, installing, and managing tools (languages,
dependency managers, libraries, and binaries) that are required at runtime. We embrace this approach
over relying on these tools "existing" in the current environment, as it ensures the following
across any environment or machine:

- The version and enabled features of a tool are identical.
- Tools are isolated and unaffected by external sources.
- Builds are consistent, reproducible, and _hopefully_ deterministic.

Furthermore, this avoids a developer, pipeline, machine, etc, having to pre-install all the
necessary tools, _and_ to keep them in sync as time passes.

## How it works

The toolchain is built around [proto](/proto), our stand-alone toolchain manager. moon will
piggyback of proto's toolchain found at `~/.proto` and reuse any tools available, or download and
install them if they're missing.

## Configuration

The tools that are managed by the toolchain are configured through the
[`.moon/toolchain.yml`](../config/toolchain) file, but can be overridden in each project with
[`moon.yml`](../config/project#toolchain).

## Supported tools

The following tools are currently managed by the toolchain.

### Node.js

- Configured with: [`node`](../config/toolchain#node)
- Installed to: `~/.proto/tools/node/x.x.x`
- Dependency managers: [`npm`](../config/toolchain#npm-pnpm-yarn),
  [`pnpm`](../config/toolchain#npm-pnpm-yarn), [`yarn`](../config/toolchain#npm-pnpm-yarn)
