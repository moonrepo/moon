import VersionLabel from '@site/src/components/Docs/VersionLabel';

The `moon.yml` configuration file _is not required_ but can be used to define additional metadata
for a project, override inherited tasks, and more at the project-level. When used, this file must
exist in a project's root, as configured in [`projects`](./workspace#projects).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
$schema: 'https://moonrepo.dev/schemas/project.json'
```

:::info

Project configuration can also be written in [Pkl](../guides/pkl-config) instead of YAML.

:::

## `dependsOn`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#dependsOn" />

Explicitly defines _other_ projects that _this_ project depends on, primarily when generating the
project and task graphs. The most common use case for this is building those projects _before_
building this one. When defined, this setting requires an array of project names, which are the keys
found in the [`projects`](./workspace#projects) map.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
dependsOn:
  - 'apiClients'
  - 'designSystem'
```

A dependency object can also be defined, where a specific `scope` can be assigned, which accepts
"production" (default), "development", "build", or "peer".

```yaml title="moon.yml"
dependsOn:
  - id: 'apiClients'
    scope: 'production'
  - id: 'designSystem'
    scope: 'peer'
```

> Learn more about [implicit and explicit dependencies](../concepts/project#dependencies).

## Metadata

## `id`<VersionLabel version="1.18.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#id" />

Overrides the name (identifier) of the project, which was configured in or derived from the
[`projects`](./workspace#projects) setting in [`.moon/workspace.yml`](./workspace). This setting is
useful when using glob based project location, and want to avoid using the folder name as the
project name.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
id: 'custom-id'
```

:::info

All references to the project must use the new identifier, including project and task dependencies.

:::

## `language`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#language" />

The primary programming language the project is written in. This setting is required for
[task inheritance](./tasks), editor extensions, and more. Supports the following values:

- `bash` - A [Bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>) based project (Unix only).
- `batch` - A [Batch](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Batch_Scripting)/PowerShell based
  project (Windows only).
- `go` - A [Go](https://go.dev/) based project.
- `javascript` - A [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) based
  project.
- `php` - A [PHP](https://www.php.net) based project.
- `python` - A [Python](https://www.python.org/) based project.
- `ruby` - A [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) based project.
- `rust` - A [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) based project.
- `typescript` - A [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) based project.
- `unknown` (default) - When not configured or inferred.
- `*` - A custom language. Values will be converted to kebab-case.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
language: 'javascript'

# Custom
language: 'kotlin'
```

> For convenience, when this setting is not defined, moon will attempt to detect the language based
> on configuration files found in the project root. This only applies to non-custom languages!

## `owners`<VersionLabel version="1.8.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#owners" />

Defines ownership of source code within the current project, by mapping file system paths to owners.
An owner is either a user, team, or group.

Currently supports
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners),
[GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/codeowners/reference.html), and
[Bitbucket](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218598/code-owners-for-bitbucket?tab=overview&hosting=cloud)
(via app).

### `customGroups`<RequiredLabel text="Bitbucket" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/OwnersConfig#customGroups" />

When using the
[Code Owners for Bitbucket](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218598/code-owners-for-bitbucket?tab=overview&hosting=cloud)
app, this setting provides a way to define custom groups that will be injected at the top of the
`CODEOWNERS` file. These groups _must_ be unique across all projects.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {2,3}
owners:
  customGroups:
    '@@@backend': ['@"user name"', '@@team']
```

### `defaultOwner`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/OwnersConfig#defaultOwner" />

The default owner for all [`paths`](#paths). This setting is optional in some cases but helps to
avoid unnecessary repetition.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {2}
owners:
  defaultOwner: '@frontend'
```

### `optional`<RequiredLabel text="GitLab" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/OwnersConfig#optional" />

For GitLab, marks the project's
[code owners section](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/codeowners/reference.html#optional-sections)
as optional. Defaults to `false`.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {2}
owners:
  optional: true
```

### `paths`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/OwnersConfig#paths" />

The primary setting for defining ownership of source code within the current project. This setting
supports 2 formats, the first being a list of file paths relative from the current project. This
format requires [`defaultOwner`](#defaultowner) to be defined, and only supports 1 owner for every
path (the default owner).

```yaml title="moon.yml" {3-6}
owners:
  defaultOwner: '@frontend'
  paths:
    - '**/*.ts'
    - '**/*.tsx'
    - '*.config.js'
```

The second format provides far more granularity, allowing for multiple owners per path. This format
requires a map, where the key is a file path relative from the current project, and the value is a
list of owners. Paths with an empty list of owners will fallback to [`defaultOwner`](#defaultowner).

```yaml title="moon.yml" {3-6}
owners:
  defaultOwner: '@frontend'
  paths:
    '**/*.rs': ['@backend']
    '**/*.js': []
    '*.config.js': ['@frontend', '@frontend-infra']
```

> The syntax for owners is dependent on the provider you are using for version control (GitHub,
> GitLab, Bitbucket). moon provides no validation or guarantees that these are correct.

### `requiredApprovals`<RequiredLabel text="Bitbucket / GitLab" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/OwnersConfig#requiredApprovals" />

Requires a specific number of approvals for a pull/merge request to be satisfied. Defaults to `1`.

- For Bitbucket, defines the
  [`Check()` condition](https://docs.mibexsoftware.com/codeowners/merge-checks#MergeChecks-2.MergeChecks:HowmanyoftheseCodeOwnersneedtoapprovebeforeapullrequestcanbemerged?)
  when using a [`defaultOwner`](#defaultowner).
- For GitLab, defines a requirement on the
  [code owners section](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/codeowners/reference.html#sections-requiring-multiple-approvals).

```yaml title="moon.yml" {2}
owners:
  requiredApprovals: 2
```

## `project`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#project" />

The `project` setting defines metadata about the project itself.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
project:
  name: 'moon'
  description: 'A monorepo management tool.'
  channel: '#moon'
  owner: 'infra.platform'
  maintainers: ['miles.johnson']
```

The information listed within `project` is purely informational and primarily displayed within the
CLI. However, this setting exists for you, your team, and your company, as a means to identify and
organize all projects. Feel free to build your own tooling around these settings!

### `channel`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectMetadataConfig#channel" />

The Slack, Discord, Teams, IRC, etc channel name (with leading #) in which to discuss the project.

### `description`<RequiredLabel />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectMetadataConfig#description" />

A description of what the project does and aims to achieve. Be as descriptive as possible, as this
is the kind of information search engines would index on.

### `maintainers`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectMetadataConfig#maintainers" />

A list of people/developers that maintain the project, review code changes, and can provide support.
Can be a name, email, LDAP name, GitHub username, etc, the choice is yours.

### `metadata`<VersionLabel version="1.27.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectMetadataConfig#metadata" />

A map of custom metadata to associate to this project. Supports all value types that are valid JSON.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
project:
  # ...
  metadata:
    deprecated: true
```

### `name`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectMetadataConfig#name" />

A human readable name of the project. This is _different_ from the unique project name configured in
[`projects`](./workspace#projects).

### `owner`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectMetadataConfig#owner" />

The team or organization that owns the project. Can be a title, LDAP name, GitHub team, etc. We
suggest _not_ listing people/developers as the owner, use [maintainers](#maintainers) instead.

## `stack`<VersionLabel version="1.22.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#stack" />

The technology stack this project belongs to, primarily for categorization. Supports the following
values:

- `frontend` - Client-side user interfaces, etc.
- `backend` - Server-side APIs, database layers, etc.
- `infrastructure` - Cloud/server infrastructure, Docker, etc.
- `systems` - Low-level systems programming.
- `unknown` (default) - When not configured.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
stack: 'frontend'
```

:::info

The project stack is also used in [constraints and boundaries](./workspace#constraints)!

:::

## `tags`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#tags" />

Tags are a simple mechanism for categorizing projects. They can be used to group projects together
for [easier querying](../commands/query/projects), enforcing of
[project boundaries and constraints](./workspace#constraints),
[task inheritance](../concepts/task-inheritance), and more.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tags:
  - 'react'
  - 'prisma'
```

## `type`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#type" />

The type of project. Supports the following values:

- `application` - An application of any kind.
- `automation` - An automated testing suite, like E2E, integration, or visual tests.
  <VersionLabel version="1.16.0" />
- `configuration` - Configuration files or infrastructure.
  <VersionLabel version="1.22.0" />
- `library` - A self-contained, shareable, and publishable set of code.
- `scaffolding` - Templates or generators for scaffolding.
  <VersionLabel version="1.22.0" />
- `tool` - An internal tool, one-off script, etc.
- `unknown` (default) - When not configured.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
type: 'application'
```

:::info

The project type is used in [task inheritance](../concepts/task-inheritance),
[constraints and boundaries](./workspace#constraints), editor extensions, and more!

:::

## Integrations

## `docker`<VersionLabel version="1.27.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#docker" />

Configures Docker integration for the current project.

### `file`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectDockerConfig#file" />

Configures the `Dockerfile` generation process when [`moon docker file`](../commands/docker/file) is
executed.

#### `buildTask`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectDockerFileConfig#buildTask" />

The name of a task within the current project that will be used for building the project before
running it. If not defined, does nothing.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {3}
docker:
  file:
    buildTask: 'build'
```

#### `image`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectDockerFileConfig#image" />

The Docker image to use in the base stage. Defaults to an image based on the project's toolchain, as
outlined below.

- `oven/bun:latest` for Bun
- `denoland/deno:latest` for Deno
- `node:latest` for Node.js
- `python:latest` for Python
- `rust:latest` for Rust
- `scratch` for everything else

```yaml title="moon.yml" {3}
docker:
  file:
    image: 'node:latest'
```

#### `startTask`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectDockerFileConfig#startTask" />

The name of a task within the current project that will run the project after it has been built (if
required). This task will be used as `CMD` within the `Dockerfile`.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {3}
docker:
  file:
    startTask: 'start'
```

### `scaffold`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectDockerConfig#scaffold" />

Configures aspects of the Docker scaffolding process when
[`moon docker scaffold`](../commands/docker/scaffold) is executed. Only applies to the
[sources skeleton](../commands/docker/scaffold#sources).

#### `include`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectDockerScaffoldConfig#include" />

List of globs in which to copy project-relative files into the `.moon/docker/sources` skeleton. When
not defined, defaults to `**/*`.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {3,4}
docker:
  scaffold:
    include:
      - 'src/**/*'
```

## Tasks

## `env`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#env" />

The `env` field is map of strings that are passed as environment variables to _all tasks_ within the
current project. Project-level variables will not override task-level variables of the same name.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
env:
  NODE_ENV: 'production'
```

> View the task [`env`](#env-1) setting for more usage examples and information.

## `fileGroups`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#fileGroups" />

Defines [file groups](../concepts/file-group) to be used by local tasks. By default, this setting
_is not required_ for the following reasons:

- File groups are an optional feature, and are designed for advanced use cases.
- File groups defined in [`.moon/tasks.yml`](./tasks) will be inherited by all projects.

When defined this setting requires a map, where the key is the file group name, and the value is a
list of [globs or file paths](../concepts/file-pattern), or environment variables. Globs and paths
are [relative to a project](../concepts/file-pattern#project-relative) (even when defined
[globally](./tasks)).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
# Example groups
fileGroups:
  configs:
    - '*.config.{js,cjs,mjs}'
    - '*.json'
  sources:
    - 'src/**/*'
    - 'types/**/*'
  tests:
    - 'tests/**/*'
    - '**/__tests__/**/*'
  assets:
    - 'assets/**/*'
    - 'images/**/*'
    - 'static/**/*'
    - '**/*.{scss,css}'
```

Once your groups have been defined, you can reference them within [`args`](#args),
[`inputs`](#inputs), [`outputs`](#outputs), and more, using
[token functions and variables](../concepts/token).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'vite build'
    inputs:
      - '@group(configs)'
      - '@group(sources)'
```

## `platform`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#platform" />

:::warning

This setting is deprecated, use [`toolchain.default`](#toolchain-1) instead.

:::

The default [`platform`](#platform-1) for all task's within the current project. When a task's
`platform` has _not been_ explicitly configured, the platform will fallback to this configured
value, otherwise the platform will be detected from the project's environment.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
platform: 'node'
```

## `tasks`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#tasks" />

Tasks are actions that are ran within the context of a [project](../concepts/project), and commonly
wrap an npm binary or system command. This setting requires a map, where the key is a unique name
for the task, and the value is an object of task parameters.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  format:
    command: 'prettier'
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
  test:
    command: 'jest'
  typecheck:
    command: 'tsc'
```

### `extends`<VersionLabel version="1.12.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#extends" />

The `extends` field can be used to extend the settings from a sibling task within the same project,
or [inherited from the global scope](../concepts/task-inheritance). This is useful for composing
similar tasks with different arguments or options.

When extending another task, the same
[merge strategies](../concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) used for inheritance are applied.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {8}
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint .'
    inputs:
      - 'src/**/*'

  lint-fix:
    extends: 'lint'
    args: '--fix'
    local: true
```

### `description`<VersionLabel version="1.22.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#description" />

A human-readable description of what the task does. This information is displayed within the
[`moon project`](../commands/project) and [`moon task`](../commands/task) commands.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {3}
tasks:
  build:
    description: 'Builds the project using Vite'
    command: 'vite build'
```

### `command`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#command" />

The `command` field is a _single_ command to execute for the task, including the command binary/name
(must be first) and any optional [arguments](#args). This field supports task inheritance and
merging of arguments.

This setting can be defined using a string, or an array of strings. We suggest using arrays when
dealing with many args, or the args string cannot be parsed easily.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4,6-9}
tasks:
  format:
    # Using a string
    command: 'prettier --check .'
    # Using an array
    command:
      - 'prettier'
      - '--check'
      - '.'
```

:::info

If you need to support pipes, redirects, or multiple commands, use [`script`](#script) instead.
Learn more about [commands vs scripts](../concepts/task#commands-vs-scripts).

:::

#### Special commands

For interoperability reasons, the following command names have special handling.

- `noop`, `no-op`, `nop` - Marks the task as a "no operation". Will not execute a command in the
  action pipeline but can define dependencies.
- When `toolchain` is "bun":
  - `bun`, `bunx` - Uses the binaries from the toolchain.
- When `toolchain` is "deno":
  - Will execute with `deno` binary.
- When `toolchain` is "node":
  - `node`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn` - Uses the binaries from the toolchain.
- When `toolchain` is "rust":
  - Will execute with `cargo` binary.

### `args`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#args" />

The `args` field is a collection of _additional_ arguments to append to the [`command`](#command)
when executing the task. This field exists purely to provide arguments for
[inherited tasks](./tasks#tasks).

This setting can be defined using a string, or an array of strings. We suggest using arrays when
dealing with many args, or the args string cannot be parsed easily.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5,7-10}
tasks:
  test:
    command: 'jest'
    # Using a string
    args: '--color --maxWorkers 3'
    # Using an array
    args:
      - '--color'
      - '--maxWorkers'
      - '3'
```

However, for the array approach to work correctly, each argument _must_ be its own distinct item,
including argument values. For example:

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  test:
    command: 'jest'
    args:
      # Valid
      - '--maxWorkers'
      - '3'
      # Also valid
      - '--maxWorkers=3'
      # Invalid
      - '--maxWorkers 3'
```

### `deps`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#deps" />

The `deps` field is a list of other tasks (known as [targets](../concepts/target)), either within
this project or found in another project, that will be executed _before_ this task. It achieves this
by generating a directed task graph based on the project graph.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4-8}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    deps:
      - 'apiClients:build'
      - 'designSystem:build'
      # A task within the current project
      - 'codegen'
```

#### Args & env

Furthermore, for each dependency target, you can configure additional command line arguments and
environment variables that'll be passed to the dependent task when it is ran. The `args` field
supports a string or a list of strings, while `env` is an object of key-value pairs.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4-8}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    deps:
      - target: 'apiClients:build'
        args: '--env production'
        env:
          NODE_ENV: 'production'
```

> Dependencies of inherited tasks will be excluded and renamed according to the
> [`workspace.inheritedTasks`](#inheritedtasks) setting. This process _only_ uses filters from the
> current project, and not filters from dependent projects. Furthermore, `args` and `env` are not
> deeply merged.

#### Optional

By default, all dependencies are required to exist when tasks are being built and expanded, but this
isn't always true when dealing with composition and inheritance. For dependencies that may not exist
based on what's inherited, you can mark it as `optional`.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4-6}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    deps:
      - target: 'apiClients:build'
        optional: true
```

### `env`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#env" />

The `env` field is map of strings that are passed as environment variables when running the command.
Variables defined here will take precedence over those loaded with [`envFile`](#envfile).

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4,5}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    env:
      NODE_ENV: 'production'
```

Variables also support substitution using the syntax `${VAR_NAME}`. When using substitution, only
variables in the current process can be referenced, and not those currently defined in `env`.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4,5}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    env:
      APP_TARGET: '${REGION}-${ENVIRONMENT}'
```

### `inputs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#inputs" />

The `inputs` field is a list of sources that calculate whether to execute this task based on the
environment and files that have been touched since the last time the task has been ran. If _not_
defined or inherited, then all files within a project are considered an input (`**/*`), excluding
root-level tasks.

Inputs support the following source types:

- Environment variables (must start with a `$`)
- Environment variable wildcards (must start with a `$` and contain `*`)
  <VersionLabel version="1.22.0" />
- Files, folders, and globs
  ([project and workspace relative file patterns](../concepts/file-pattern#project-relative))
- [Token functions and variables](../concepts/token)

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4-12}
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    inputs:
      # Config files anywhere within the project
      - '**/.eslintignore'
      - '**/.eslintrc.js'
      # Config files at the workspace root
      - '/.eslintignore'
      - '/.eslintrc.js'
      # Environment variables
      - '$ESLINT_CACHE'
      - '$ESLINT_*'
      # Tokens
      - '$projectRoot'
      - '@group(sources)'
```

:::caution

When using an environment variable, we assume _it's not defined_ by default, and will trigger an
affected state when it _is_ defined. If the environment variable always exists, then the task will
always run and bypass the cache.

:::

:::danger

When using globs, be aware that files that match the glob, but are ignored via `.gitignore` (or
similar), will _not_ be considered an input. To work around this, use explicit file inputs.

:::

### `local`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#local" />

:::info

This setting is deprecated and will be removed in v2. We suggest using [`preset`](#preset) instead.

:::

Marks the task as local only. This should primarily be enabled for long-running or never-ending
tasks, like development servers and watch mode. Defaults to `true` if the task name is "dev",
"start", or "serve", and `false` otherwise.

This is a convenience setting for local development that sets the following task options:

- [`cache`](#cache) -> Turned off
- [`outputStyle`](#outputstyle) -> Set to "stream"
- [`persistent`](#persistent) -> Turned on
- [`runInCI`](#runinci) -> Turned off

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  dev:
    command: 'webpack server'
    local: true
```

### `outputs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#outputs" />

The `outputs` field is a list of [files and folders](../concepts/file-pattern#project-relative) that
are _created_ as a result of executing this task, typically from a build or compilation related
task. Outputs are necessary for [incremental caching and hydration](../concepts/cache). If you'd
prefer to avoid that functionality, omit this field.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4-6}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    outputs:
      # Relative from project root
      - 'build/'
```

Globs can also be used if you'd like to restrict which files are cached. For example, when building
a JavaScript project, you may want to include `.js` files, but exclude `.map` and other files.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4-6}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    outputs:
      - 'build/**/*.js'
      - '!build/internal.js'
```

:::caution

When using globs and moon hydrates an output (a cache hit), all files not matching the glob will be
**deleted**. Ensure that all files critical for the build to function correctly are included.

:::

### `platform`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#platform" />

:::warning

This setting is deprecated, use [`toolchain`](#toolchain) instead.

:::

The `platform` field defines the platform (language runtime) the command runs on, where to locate
its executable, and which tool to execute it with. By default moon will set to a value based on the
project's [`language`](#language) or default [`platform`](#platform).

- `bun` - Command is a binary within `node_modules` and will be executed with Bun.
  <VersionLabel version="1.17.0" />
- `deno` - Command is executed with Deno, or is a Deno binary located in `~/.deno/bin`.
- `node` - Command is a binary within `node_modules` and will be executed with Node.js.
- `rust` - Command is executed with Cargo, or is a Cargo binary located in `~/.cargo/bin`.
- `system` - Command is expected to exist within the system's environment / user's shell.
- `unknown` - When not configured or inferred.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4}
tasks:
  env:
    command: 'printenv'
    platform: 'system'
```

> This field exists because of our [toolchain](../concepts/toolchain), and moon ensuring the correct
> command is ran.

### `preset`<VersionLabel version="1.28.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#preset" />

Applies the chosen preset to the task. A preset defines a collection of task options that will be
inherited as the default, and can then be overridden within the task itself. The following presets
are available:

- `server`
  - [`cache`](#cache) -> Turned off
  - [`outputStyle`](#outputstyle) -> Set to "stream"
  - [`persistent`](#persistent) -> Turned on
  - [`runInCI`](#runinci) -> Turned off
- `watcher`
  - Inherits `server` options
  - [`interactive`](#interactive) -> Turned on

Tasks named "dev", "start", or "serve" are marked as `server` automatically.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  dev:
    command: 'webpack server'
    preset: 'server'
```

### `script`<VersionLabel version="1.27.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#script" />

The `script` field is _one or many_ commands to execute for the task, with support for pipes,
redirects, and more. This field does _not_ support task inheritance merging, and can only be defined
with a string.

If defined, will supersede [`command`](#command) and [`args`](#args).

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4,6,8,10}
tasks:
  exec:
    # Single command
    script: 'cp ./in ./out'
    # Multiple commands
    script: 'rm -rf ./out && cp ./in ./out'
    # Pipes
    script: 'ps aux | grep 3000'
    # Redirects
    script: './gen.sh > out.json'
```

:::info

If you need to support merging during task inheritance, use [`command`](#command) instead. Learn
more about [commands vs scripts](../concepts/task#commands-vs-scripts).

:::

### `toolchain`<VersionLabel version="1.31.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#toolchain" />

The `toolchain` field defines the [toolchain (language runtime)](../concepts/toolchain) the command
runs on, where to locate its executable, and which tool to execute it with. By default, moon will
set to a value based on the project's [`language`](#language) or default
[`toolchain.default`](#toolchain-1).

- `bun` - Command is a binary within `node_modules` and will be executed with Bun.
  <VersionLabel version="1.17.0" />
- `deno` - Command is executed with Deno, or is a Deno binary located in `~/.deno/bin`.
- `node` - Command is a binary within `node_modules` and will be executed with Node.js.
- `rust` - Command is executed with Cargo, or is a Cargo binary located in `~/.cargo/bin`.
- `system` - Command is expected to exist within the system's environment / user's shell.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4}
tasks:
  env:
    command: 'printenv'
    toolchain: 'system'
```

### `options`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#options" />

The `options` field is an object of configurable options that can be used to modify the task and its
execution. The following fields can be provided, with merge related fields supporting all
[merge strategies](../concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  typecheck:
    command: 'tsc --noEmit'
    options:
      mergeArgs: 'replace'
      runFromWorkspaceRoot: true
```

#### `affectedFiles`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#affectedFiles" />

When enabled and the [`--affected` option](../run-task#running-based-on-affected-files-only) is
provided, all affected files that match this task's [`inputs`](#inputs) will be passed as relative
file paths as command line arguments, and as a `MOON_AFFECTED_FILES` environment variable.

If there are no affected files, `.` (current directory) will be passed instead for arguments, and an
empty value for the environment variable. This functionality can be changed with the
[`affectedPassInputs`](#affectedpassinputs) setting.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5,7,9}
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    options:
      affectedFiles: true
      # Only pass args
      affectedFiles: 'args'
      # Only set env var
      affectedFiles: 'env'
```

:::caution

When using this option, ensure that explicit files or `.` _are not present_ in the [`args`](#args)
list. Furthermore, this functionality will only work if the task's command supports an arbitrary
list of files being passed as arguments.

:::

#### `affectedPassInputs`<VersionLabel version="1.22.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#affectedPassInputs" />

When [`affectedFiles`](#affectedfiles) is enabled, and no affected files are found, moon will pass
`.` as an argument. For the most part, this works, but if you'd like to _not_ pass the entire
directory (and everything in it), and only pass the configured [`inputs`](#inputs) instead, then you
can enable this setting.

When enabled, moon will resolve all input globs to literal file paths, and pass them as relative
arguments.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5,6}
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    options:
      affectedFiles: true
      affectedPassInputs: true
```

#### `allowFailure`<VersionLabel version="1.13.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#allowFailure" />

Allows a task to fail without failing the entire pipeline. When enabled, the following changes
occur:

- Other tasks _cannot_ depend on this task, as we can't ensure it's side-effect free.
- For [`moon run`](../commands/run), the process will not bail early and will run to completion.
- For [`moon ci`](../commands/ci), the process will not exit with a non-zero exit code, if the only
  failing tasks are allowed to fail.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    options:
      allowFailure: true
```

#### `cache`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#cache" />

Whether to cache the task's execution result using our [smart hashing](../concepts/cache#hashing)
system. If disabled, _will not_ create a cache hash, and _will not_ persist a task's
[outputs](#outputs). Defaults to `true`.

We suggest disabling caching when defining cleanup tasks, one-off scripts, or file system heavy
operations.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  clean:
    command: 'rm -rf ./temp'
    options:
      cache: false
```

#### `cacheKey`<VersionLabel version="1.35.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#cacheKey" />

A custom key to include in the cache and task hashing process. Can be used to invalidate local and
remote caches.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'some-costly-build'
    options:
      cacheKey: 'v1'
```

#### `cacheLifetime`<VersionLabel version="1.29.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#cacheLifetime" />

The lifetime in which a [cached task](#cache) will live before being marked as stale and re-running.
This applies to a task even if it does not produce [outputs](#outputs).

The lifetime can be configured in a human-readable string format, for example, `1 day`, `3 hr`,
`1m`, etc. If the lifetime is not defined, the cache will live forever, or until the task inputs are
touched.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'some-costly-build'
    options:
      cacheLifetime: '1 day'
```

> String formats are powered by the
> [humantime](https://docs.rs/humantime/2.1.0/humantime/fn.parse_duration.html) crate.

#### `envFile`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#envFile" />

A boolean or path to a `.env` file (also know as dotenv file) that defines a collection of
[environment variables](#env-1) for the current task. Variables will be loaded on project creation,
but will _not_ override those defined in [`env`](#env-1).

Variables defined in the file support value substitution/expansion by wrapping the variable name in
curly brackets, such as `${VAR_NAME}`.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {6,8,10}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    options:
      # Defaults to .env
      envFile: true
      # Or
      envFile: '.env.production'
      # Or from the workspace root
      envFile: '/.env.shared'
```

Additionally, a list of file paths can also be provided. When using a list, the order of the files
is important, as environment variables from all files will be aggregated into a single map, with
subsequent files taking precedence over previous ones. Once aggregated, the variables will be passed
to the task, but will _not_ override those defined in [`env`](#env-1).

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5-7}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    options:
      envFile:
        - '.env'
        - '.env.production'
```

:::caution

File parsing is done using the Rust [`dotenvy`](https://crates.io/crates/dotenvy) crate, which is
_different_ than the Node.js [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package. The biggest
differences are around quote handling and variable substitution, so be aware of this!

:::

#### `inferInputs`<VersionLabel version="1.31.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#inferInputs" />

Automatically infer [inputs](#inputs) based on the following parameters configured within the task's
`command`, `script`, `args`, or `env`. Defaults to `true`.

- File/glob paths derived from [file group based token functions](../concepts/token#file-groups).
- Environment variables being substituted within a command or script.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  build:
    # ...
    options:
      inferInputs: false
```

#### `internal`<VersionLabel version="1.23.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#internal" />

Marks the task as internal only. [Internal tasks](../concepts/task#internal-only) can not be
explicitly ran on the command line, but can be depended on by other tasks.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  prepare:
    # ...
    options:
      internal: true
```

#### `interactive`<VersionLabel version="1.12.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#interactive" />

Marks the task as interactive. [Interactive tasks](../concepts/task#interactive) run in isolation so
that they can interact with stdin.

This setting also disables caching, turns of CI, and other functionality, similar to the
[`local`](#local) setting.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  init:
    # ...
    options:
      interactive: true
```

#### `merge`<VersionLabel version="1.29.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#merge" />

The [strategy](../concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) to use when merging [`args`](#args),
[`deps`](#deps), [`env`](#env-1), [`inputs`](#inputs), and [`outputs`](#outputs) with an inherited
task. This option can be overridden with the field specific merge options below.

#### `mergeArgs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#mergeArgs" />

The [strategy](../concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) to use when merging the
[`args`](#args) list with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeDeps`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#mergeDeps" />

The [strategy](../concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) to use when merging the
[`deps`](#deps) list with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeEnv`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#mergeEnv" />

The [strategy](../concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) to use when merging the
[`env`](#env-1) map with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeInputs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#mergeInputs" />

The [strategy](../concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) to use when merging the
[`inputs`](#inputs) list with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeOutputs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#mergeOutputs" />

The [strategy](../concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) to use when merging the
[`outputs`](#outputs) list with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mutex`<VersionLabel version="1.24.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#mutex" />

Creates an exclusive lock on a "virtual resource", preventing other tasks using the same "virtual
resource" from running concurrently.

If you have many tasks that require exclusive access to a resource that can't be tracked by moon
(like a database, an ignored file, a file that's not part of the project, or a remote resource) you
can use the `mutex` option to prevent them from running at the same time.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5,10}
tasks:
  a:
    # ...
    options:
      mutex: 'virtual_resource_name'

  # b doesn't necessarily have to be in the same project
  b:
    # ...
    options:
      mutex: 'virtual_resource_name'
```

#### `os`<VersionLabel version="1.28.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#os" />

When defined, the task will _only_ run on the configured operating system. For other operating
systems, the task becomes a no-operation. Supports the values `linux`, `macos`, and `windows`.

Can be defined as a single value, or a list of values.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5,10}
tasks:
  build-unix:
    # ...
    options:
      os: ['linux', 'macos']

  build-windows:
    # ...
    options:
      os: 'windows'
```

#### `outputStyle`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#outputStyle" />

Controls how stdout/stderr is displayed when the task is ran as a _transitive target_. By default,
this setting is not defined and defers to the action pipeline, but can be overridden with one of the
following values:

- `buffer` - Buffers output and displays after the task has exited (either success or failure).
- `buffer-only-failure` - Like `buffer`, but only displays on failures.
- `hash` - Ignores output and only displays the generated [hash](../concepts/cache#hashing).
- `none` - Ignores output.
- `stream` - Streams output directly to the terminal. Will prefix each line of output with the
  target.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  test:
    # ...
    options:
      outputStyle: 'stream'
```

#### `persistent`<VersionLabel version="1.6.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#persistent" />

Marks the task as persistent (continuously running). [Persistent tasks](../concepts/task#persistent)
are handled differently than non-persistent tasks in the action graph. When running a target, all
persistent tasks are _ran last_ and _in parallel_, after all their dependencies have completed.

This is extremely useful for running a server (or a watcher) in the background while other tasks are
running.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  dev:
    # ...
    options:
      persistent: true
```

> We suggest using the [`local`](#local) setting instead, which enables this setting, amongst other
> useful settings.

#### `priority`<VersionLabel version="1.35.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#priority" />

The priority level determines the position of the task within the action pipeline queue. A task with
a higher priority will run sooner rather than later, while still respecting the topological order.
Supports the following levels:

- `critical`
- `high`
- `normal` (default)
- `low`

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  build:
    # ...
    options:
      priority: 'high'
```

#### `retryCount`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#retryCount" />

The number of attempts the task will retry execution before returning a failure. This is especially
useful for flaky tasks. Defaults to `0`.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  test:
    # ...
    options:
      retryCount: 3
```

#### `runDepsInParallel`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#runDepsInParallel" />

Whether to run the task's direct [`deps`](#deps) in parallel or serial (in order). Defaults to
`true`.

When disabled, this _does not_ run dependencies of dependencies in serial, only direct dependencies.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {8}
tasks:
  start:
    # ...
    deps:
      - '~:clean'
      - '~:build'
    options:
      runDepsInParallel: false
```

#### `runInCI`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#runInCI" />

Whether to run the task automatically in a CI (continuous integration) environment when affected by
touched files, typically through the [`moon ci`](../commands/ci) command. Supports the following
values:

- `always` - Always run in CI, regardless if affected or not. <VersionLabel version="1.31.0" />
- `true`, `affected` - Only run if affected by touched files.
- `false` - Never run in CI.

Defaults to `true` unless the [`local`](#local) setting is enabled.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  build:
    # ...
    options:
      runInCI: false
```

#### `runFromWorkspaceRoot`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#runFromWorkspaceRoot" />

Whether to use the workspace root as the working directory when executing a task. Defaults to
`false` and runs from the task's project root.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  typecheck:
    # ...
    options:
      runFromWorkspaceRoot: true
```

#### `shell`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#shell" />

Whether to run the command within a shell or not. Defaults to `true` for system toolchain or
Windows, and `false` otherwise. The shell to run is determined by the [`unixShell`](#unixshell) and
[`windowsShell`](#windowsshell) options respectively.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  native:
    command: 'echo $SHELL'
    options:
      shell: true
```

However, if you'd like to use a different shell, or customize the shell's arguments, or have
granular control, you can set `shell` to false and configure a fully qualified command.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  native:
    command: '/bin/zsh -c "echo $SHELL"'
    options:
      shell: false
```

#### `timeout`<VersionLabel version="1.26.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#timeout" />

The maximum time in seconds that the task is allowed to run, before it is force cancelled. If not
defined, will run indefinitely.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  build:
    # ...
    options:
      timeout: 120
```

#### `unixShell`<VersionLabel version="1.21.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#unixShell" />

Customize the shell to run with when on a Unix operating system. Accepts `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`,
`ion`, `murex`, `nu`, `pwsh`, `xonsh`, or `zsh`. If not defined, will derive the shell from the
`SHELL` environment variable, or defaults to `sh`.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  native:
    command: 'echo $SHELL'
    options:
      unixShell: 'fish'
```

#### `windowsShell`<VersionLabel version="1.21.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#windowsShell" />

Customize the shell to run with when on a Windows operating system. Accepts `bash` (typically via
Git), `elvish`, `fish`, `murex`, `nu`, `pwsh`, or `xonsh`. If not defined, defaults to `pwsh`.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  native:
    command: 'echo $SHELL'
    options:
      windowsShell: 'bash'
```

#### `disabled`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectToolchainTypeScriptConfig#disabled" />

Disables [TypeScript support](./toolchain#typescript) entirely for this project. Defaults to
`false`.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {3}
toolchain:
  typescript:
    disabled: true
```

#### `includeProjectReferenceSources`<VersionLabel version="1.17.0" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectToolchainTypeScriptConfig#includeProjectReferenceSources" />

Overrides the workspace-level
[`includeProjectReferenceSources`](./toolchain#includeprojectreferencesources) setting. Defaults to
undefined.

```

## `workspace`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#workspace" />

### `inheritedTasks`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectWorkspaceConfig#inheritedTasks" />

Provides a layer of control when inheriting tasks from [`.moon/tasks.yml`](./tasks).

#### `exclude`

The optional `exclude` setting permits a project to exclude specific tasks from being inherited. It
accepts a list of strings, where each string is the name of a global task to exclude.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4}
workspace:
  inheritedTasks:
    # Exclude the inherited `test` task for this project
    exclude: ['test']
```

> Exclusion is applied after inclusion and before renaming.

#### `include`

The optional `include` setting permits a project to _only_ include specific inherited tasks (works
like an allow/white list). It accepts a list of strings, where each string is the name of a global
task to include.

When this field is not defined, the project will inherit all tasks from the global project config.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4,7-9}
workspace:
  inheritedTasks:
    # Include *no* tasks (works like a full exclude)
    include: []

    # Only include the `lint` and `test` tasks for this project
    include:
      - 'lint'
      - 'test'
```

> Inclusion is applied before exclusion and renaming.

#### `rename`

The optional `rename` setting permits a project to rename the inherited task within the current
project. It accepts a map of strings, where the key is the original name (found in the global
project config), and the value is the new name to use.

For example, say we have 2 tasks in the global project config called `buildPackage` and
`buildApplication`, but we only need 1, and since we're an application, we should omit and rename.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4,5}
workspace:
  inheritedTasks:
    exclude: ['buildPackage']
    rename:
      buildApplication: 'build'
```

> Renaming occurs after inclusion and exclusion.
