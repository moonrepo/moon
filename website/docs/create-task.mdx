The primary focus of moon is a task runner, and for it to operate in any capacity, it requires tasks
to run. In moon, a task is a binary or system command that is ran as a child process within the
context of a project (is the current working directory). Tasks are defined per project with
[`moon.yml`](./config/project), or inherited by many projects with
[`.moon/tasks.yml`](./config/tasks), but can also be inferred from a language's ecosystem
([we'll talk about this later](./migrate-to-moon)).

## Configuring a task

Most — if not all projects — utilize the same core tasks: linting, testing, code formatting,
typechecking, and _building_. Because these are so universal, let's implement the build task within
a project using [`moon.yml`](./config/project).

Begin by creating the `moon.yml` file at the root of a project and add `build` to the
[`tasks`](./config/project#tasks) field, with a [`command`](./config/project#command) parameter.

import BaseGo from './__partials__/create-task/go/base.mdx';
import BaseNode from './__partials__/create-task/node/base.mdx';
import BasePHP from './__partials__/create-task/php/base.mdx';
import BasePython from './__partials__/create-task/python/base.mdx';
import BaseRuby from './__partials__/create-task/ruby/base.mdx';
import BaseRust from './__partials__/create-task/rust/base.mdx';

<LangPartials>
  <BaseGo key="go" />
  <BaseNode key="node" />
  <BasePHP key="php" />
  <BasePython key="python" />
  <BaseRuby key="ruby" />
  <BaseRust key="rust" />
</LangPartials>

By itself, this isn't doing much, so let's add some arguments. Arguments can also be defined with
the [`args`](./config/project#args) setting.

import ArgsGo from './__partials__/create-task/go/args.mdx';
import ArgsNode from './__partials__/create-task/node/args.mdx';
import ArgsPHP from './__partials__/create-task/php/args.mdx';
import ArgsPython from './__partials__/create-task/python/args.mdx';
import ArgsRuby from './__partials__/create-task/ruby/args.mdx';
import ArgsRust from './__partials__/create-task/rust/args.mdx';

<LangPartials>
  <ArgsGo key="go" />
  <ArgsNode key="node" />
  <ArgsPHP key="php" />
  <ArgsPython key="python" />
  <ArgsRuby key="ruby" />
  <ArgsRust key="rust" />
</LangPartials>

With this, the task can be ran from the command line with
[`moon run <project>:build`](./commands/run)! This is tasks in its most simplest form, but continue
reading on how to take full advantage of our task runner.

### Inputs

Our task above works, but isn't very efficient as it _always_ runs, regardless of what has changed
since the last time it has ran. This becomes problematic in continuous integration environments, not
just locally.

To mitigate this problem, moon provides a system known as inputs, which are file paths, globs, and
environment variables that are used by the task when it's ran. moon will use and compare these
inputs to calculate whether to run, or to return the previous run state from the cache.

If you're a bit confused, let's demonstrate this by expanding the task with the
[`inputs`](./config/project#inputs) setting.

import InputsGo from './__partials__/create-task/go/inputs.mdx';
import InputsNode from './__partials__/create-task/node/inputs.mdx';
import InputsPHP from './__partials__/create-task/php/inputs.mdx';
import InputsPython from './__partials__/create-task/python/inputs.mdx';
import InputsRuby from './__partials__/create-task/ruby/inputs.mdx';
import InputsRust from './__partials__/create-task/rust/inputs.mdx';

<LangPartials>
  <InputsGo key="go" />
  <InputsNode key="node" />
  <InputsPHP key="php" />
  <InputsPython key="python" />
  <InputsRuby key="ruby" />
  <InputsRust key="rust" />
</LangPartials>

This list of inputs may look complicated, but they are merely run checks. For example, when moon
detects a change in...

- Any files within the `src` folder, relative from the project's root.
- A config file in the project's root.
- A shared config file in the workspace root (denoted by the leading `/`).

...the task will be ran! If the change occurs _outside_ of the project or _outside_ the list of
inputs, the task will _not_ be ran.

:::tip

Inputs are a powerful feature that can be fine-tuned to your project's need. Be as granular or open
as you want, the choice is yours!

### Outputs

Outputs are the opposite of [inputs](#inputs), as they are files and folders that are created as a
result of running the task. With that being said, outputs are _optional_, as not all tasks require
them, and the ones that do are typically build related.

Now why is declaring outputs important? For incremental builds and smart caching! When moon
encounters a build that has already been built, it hydrates all necessary outputs from the cache,
then immediately exits. No more waiting for long builds!

Continuing our example, let's route the built files and expand our task with the
[`outputs`](./config/project#outputs) setting.

import OutputsGo from './__partials__/create-task/go/outputs.mdx';
import OutputsNode from './__partials__/create-task/node/outputs.mdx';
import OutputsPHP from './__partials__/create-task/php/outputs.mdx';
import OutputsPython from './__partials__/create-task/python/outputs.mdx';
import OutputsRuby from './__partials__/create-task/ruby/outputs.mdx';
import OutputsRust from './__partials__/create-task/rust/outputs.mdx';

<LangPartials>
  <OutputsGo key="go" />
  <OutputsNode key="node" />
  <OutputsPHP key="php" />
  <OutputsPython key="python" />
  <OutputsRuby key="ruby" />
  <OutputsRust key="rust" />
</LangPartials>

## Depending on other tasks

For scenarios where you need run a task _before_ another task, as you're expecting some repository
state or artifact to exist, can be achieved with the [`deps`](./config/project#deps) setting, which
requires a list of [targets](./concepts/target):

- `<project>:<task>` - Full canonical target.
- `~:<task>` or `<task>` - A task within the current project.
- `^:<task>` - A task from all [depended on projects](./concepts/project#dependencies).

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml" {1,7,8}
dependsOn:
	# ...

tasks:
	build:
		# ...
		deps:
			- '^:build'
```

## Using file groups

Once you're familiar with configuring tasks, you may notice certain inputs being repeated
constantly, like source files, test files, and configuration. To reduce the amount of boilerplate
required, moon provides a feature known as [file groups](./concepts/file-group), which enables
grouping of similar file types within a project using
[file glob patterns or literal file paths](./concepts/file-pattern).

File groups are defined with the [`fileGroups`](./config/project#filegroups) setting, which maps a
list of file paths/globs to a group, like so.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
fileGroups:
	configs:
		- '*.config.js'
	sources:
		- 'src/**/*'
		- 'types/**/*'
	tests:
		- 'tests/**/*'
```

We can then replace the inputs in our task above with these new file groups using a syntax known as
[tokens](./concepts/token), specifically the [`@globs`](./concepts/token#globs) and
[`@files`](./concepts/token#files) token functions. Tokens are an advanced feature, so please refer
to their documentation for more information!

import FilegroupsGo from './__partials__/create-task/go/filegroups.mdx';
import FilegroupsNode from './__partials__/create-task/node/filegroups.mdx';
import FilegroupsPHP from './__partials__/create-task/php/filegroups.mdx';
import FilegroupsPython from './__partials__/create-task/python/filegroups.mdx';
import FilegroupsRuby from './__partials__/create-task/ruby/filegroups.mdx';
import FilegroupsRust from './__partials__/create-task/rust/filegroups.mdx';

<LangPartials>
  <FilegroupsGo key="go" />
  <FilegroupsNode key="node" />
  <FilegroupsPHP key="php" />
  <FilegroupsPython key="python" />
  <FilegroupsRuby key="ruby" />
  <FilegroupsRust key="rust" />
</LangPartials>

With file groups (and tokens), you're able to reduce the amount of configuration required _and_
encourage certain file structures for consuming projects!
