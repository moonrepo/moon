Enhance your VS Code experience with our integrated moon console! Whether you're a fan of the
command line, or prefer interactive interfaces, our console will be a welcome experience.

> This extension is in its early stages. Expect more advanced features in the future, like

### Projects

The backbone of moon is the projects view. In this view, all moon configured projects will be
listed, categorized by their [`type`](../config/project#type), and designated with their
[`language`](../config/project#language).

Each project can then be expanded to view all available tasks. Tasks can be ran by clicking the `▶`
icon, or using the command palette.

> This view is available in both the "Explorer" and "moon" sidebars.

</TwoColumn>

<TwoColumn
  aside={<Image src={require('./vscode/last-run-view.png')} alt="VS Code view - Last run" />}

### Last run

Information about the last ran target will be displayed in a beautiful table with detailed stats.
Only tasks ran from the [projects view](#projects), or with `--report` on the command line will be
displayed here.

This table displays all actions that were ran alongside the running primary target(s). They are
ordered topologically via the dependency graph.
