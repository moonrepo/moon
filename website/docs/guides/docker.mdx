Using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run your applications? Or build your artifacts? No
worries, moon can be utilized with Docker, and supports a robust integration layer.

## Performance improvements

For the most part, everything should just work, but we have disabled caching and hashing in Docker
containers and images for the following reasons:

- Avoids having to mount a volume for the `.git` directory.
- Reduces the overall image size as we're avoiding creating tarballs.
- Ensures that builds are fresh and up-to-date.

## Dockerfile

We're very familiar with how tedious `Dockerfile`s are to write and maintain, so in an effort to
reduce this headache, we've built a handful of tools to make this process much easier. With moon,
we'll take advantage of Docker's layer caching and staged builds as much as possible.

With that being said, there's many approaches you can utilize, depending on your workflow (we'll
document them below):

- Running `moon docker` commands _before_ running `docker run|build` commands.
- Running `moon docker` commands _within_ the `Dockerfile`.
- Using multi-staged or standard builds.
- Something else unique to your setup!

### What we're trying to avoid

Before we dive into writing a perfect `Dockerfile`, we'll briefly talk about the pain points we're
trying to avoid. In the context of Node.js and monorepo's, you may be familiar with having to `COPY`
each individual `package.json` in the monorepo before installing `node_modules`, to effectively use
layer caching. This is very brittle, as each new application or package is created, every
`Dockerfile` in the monorepo will need to be modified to account for this new `package.json`.

Furthermore, we'll have to follow a similar process for _only copying source files_ necessary for
the build or `CMD` to complete. This is _very tedious_, so most developers simply use `COPY . .` and
forget about it. Copying the entire monorepo is costly, especially as it grows.

As an example, we'll use moon's official repository. The `Dockerfile` would look something like the
following.

```docker
FROM node:latest

WORKDIR /app

# Install moon binary
RUN npm install -g @moonrepo/cli

# Copy moon files
COPY ./.moon ./.moon

# Copy all package.json's and lockfiles
COPY ./packages/cli/package.json ./packages/cli/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-linux-arm64-gnu/package.json ./packages/core-linux-arm64-gnu/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-linux-arm64-musl/package.json ./packages/core-linux-arm64-musl/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-linux-x64-gnu/package.json ./packages/core-linux-x64-gnu/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-linux-x64-musl/package.json ./packages/core-linux-x64-musl/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-macos-arm64/package.json ./packages/core-macos-arm64/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-macos-x64/package.json ./packages/core-macos-x64/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-windows-x64-msvc/package.json ./packages/core-windows-x64-msvc/package.json
COPY ./packages/runtime/package.json ./packages/runtime/package.json
COPY ./packages/types/package.json ./packages/types/package.json
COPY ./package.json ./package.json
COPY ./yarn.lock ./yarn.lock
COPY ./.yarn ./.yarn
COPY ./.yarnrc.yml ./yarnrc.yml

# Install toolchain and dependencies
RUN moon setup

# Copy project and required files
COPY ./packages/types ./packages/types
COPY ./packages/runtime ./packages/runtime
# OR COPY . .

# Build the target
RUN moon run runtime:build
```

For such a small monorepo, this already looks too confusing!!! Let's remedy this by utilizing moon
itself to the fullest!

### Scaffolding the bare minimum

The first step in this process is to only copy the bare minimum of files necessary for installing
dependencies (Node.js modules, etc). This is typically manifests (`package.json`), lockfiles
(`yarn.lock`, etc), and any configuration (`.yarnrc.yml`, etc).

This can all be achieved by the [`moon docker scaffold`][scaffold] command, which scaffolds a
skeleton of the repository structure, with only necessary files (the above). Let's update our
`Dockerfile` usage.

<Tabs
  groupId="dockerfile"
  defaultValue="standard"
  values={[
    { label: 'Standard', value: 'standard' },
    { label: 'Multi-staged', value: 'staged' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="standard">

This assumes [`moon docker scaffold <project>`][scaffold] is ran outside of the `Dockerfile`.

```docker
FROM node:latest
WORKDIR /app

# Install moon binary
RUN npm install -g @moonrepo/cli

# Copy workspace skeleton
COPY ./.moon/docker/workspace .

# Install toolchain and dependencies
RUN moon setup
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="staged">

```docker
#### BASE
FROM node:latest AS base
WORKDIR /app

# Install moon binary
RUN npm install -g @moonrepo/cli

#### WORKSPACE
FROM base AS workspace
WORKDIR /app

# Copy entire repository and scaffold
COPY . .
RUN moon docker scaffold <project>

#### BUILD
FROM base AS build
WORKDIR /app

# Copy workspace skeleton
COPY --from=workspace /app/.moon/docker/workspace .

# Install toolchain and dependencies
RUN moon setup
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

And with this, our dependencies will be layer cached effectively! Let's now move onto copying source
files.

### Copying necessary source files

The next step is to copy all source files necessary for `CMD` or any `RUN` commands to execute
correctly. This typically requires copying all source files for the project _and_ all source files
of the project's dependencies... NOT the entire repository!

Luckily our [`moon docker scaffold <project>`][scaffold] command has already done this for us! Let's
continue updating our `Dockerfile` to account for this, by appending the following:

<Tabs
  groupId="dockerfile"
  defaultValue="standard"
  values={[
    { label: 'Standard', value: 'standard' },
    { label: 'Multi-staged', value: 'staged' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="standard">

```docker
# Copy source files
COPY ./.moon/docker/sources .

# Run something
RUN moon run <project>:<task>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="staged">

```docker
# Copy source files
COPY --from=workspace /app/.moon/docker/sources .

# Run something
RUN moon run <project>:<task>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

If you need additional files for your commands to run successfully, you can manually use `COPY` or
pass `--include` to the scaffold command.

:::

### Pruning extraneous files

Now that we've ran a command or built an artifact, we should prune the Docker environment to remove
unneeded files and folders. We can do this with the [`moon docker prune`][prune] command, which
_must be ran_ within the context of a `Dockerfile`!

```docker
# Prune workspace
RUN moon docker prune
```

When ran, this command will do the following:

- Install production only dependencies for the projects that were scaffolded.
- Remove extraneous dependencies (`node_modules`) for unfocused projects.

### Final result

And with this moon integration, we've reduced the original `Dockerfile` of 35 lines to 18 lines, a
reduction of almost 50%. The original file can also be seen as `O(n)`, as each new manifest requires
cascading updates, while the moon approach is `O(1)`!
