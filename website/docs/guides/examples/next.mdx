In this guide, you'll learn how to integrate [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) into moon.

Begin by creating a new Next.js project at a specified folder path (this should not be created in
the workspace root, unless a polyrepo).

```shell
cd apps && npx create-next-app <project> --typescript
```

> View the [official Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup) for a
> more in-depth guide to getting started!

## Setup

Since Next.js is per-project, the associated moon tasks should be defined in each project's
[`moon.yml`](../../config/project) file.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
fileGroups:
	next:
		- 'pages/**/*'
		- 'public/**/*'
		- 'src/**/*'
		- 'next-env.d.ts'
		- 'next.config.*'

tasks:
	# Development server
	dev:
		command: 'next dev'
		local: true

	# Production build (SSR)
	build:
		command: 'next build'
		inputs:
			- '@group(next)'

	# Production build (SSG)
	export:
		command: 'next export -o ./build'
		deps:
			- '~:build'
		inputs:
			- '@group(next)'
		outputs:
			- 'build'

	# Serve the build
	start:
		command: 'next start'
		local: true
```

### ESLint integration

Next.js has [built-in support for ESLint](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint), which is
great, but complicates things a bit. Because of this, you have two options for moving forward:

- Use a [global `lint` task](./eslint) and bypass Next.js's solution (preferred).
- Use Next.js's solution only.

Regardless of which option is chosen, the following changes are applicable to all options and should
be made. Begin be installing the
[`eslint-config-next`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint#eslint-config) dependency in
the application's `package.json`.

<AddDepsTabs dep="eslint-config-next" package="<project>" dev />

Since the Next.js app is located within a subfolder, we'll need to tell the ESLint plugin where to
locate it. This can be achieved with a project-level `.eslintrc.js` file.

```js title="<project>/.eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  extends: 'next', // or 'next/core-web-vitals'
  settings: {
    next: {
      rootDir: __dirname,
    },
  },
};
```

With the basics now setup, choose the option that works best for you.

<Tabs
  groupId="lint-type"
  defaultValue="global"
  values={[
    { label: 'Global lint', value: 'global' },
    { label: 'Next.js lint', value: 'nextjs' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="global">

We encourage using the global `lint` task for consistency across all projects within the repository.
With this approach, the `eslint` command itself will be ran and the `next lint` command will be
ignored, but the `eslint-config-next` rules will still be used.

Additionally, we suggest disabling the linter during the build process, but is not a requirement. As
a potential alternative, add the `lint` task as a dependency for the `build` task.

```js title="<project>/next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nextjs">

If you'd prefer to use the `next lint` command, add it as a task to the project's
[`moon.yml`](../../config/project).

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
tasks:
	lint:
		command: 'next lint'
		inputs:
			- '@group(next)'
```

Furthermore, if a global `lint` task exists, be sure to exclude it from being inherited.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
workspace:
  inheritedTasks:
    exclude: ['lint']
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### TypeScript integration

Next.js also has
[built-in support for TypeScript](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript), but has
similar caveats to the [ESLint integration](#eslint-integration). TypeScript itself is a bit
involved, so we suggest reading the official Next.js documentation before continuing.

At this point we'll assume that a `tsconfig.json` has been created in the application, and
type-checking works. From here we suggest utilizing a [global `typecheck` task](./typescript) for
consistency across all projects within the repository.

Additionally, we suggest disabling the type-checker during the build process, but is not a
requirement. As a potential alternative, add the `typecheck` task as a dependency for the `build`
task.

```js title="<project>/next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
};
```

## Configuration

### Root-level

We suggest _against_ root-level configuration, as Next.js should be installed per-project, and the
`next` command expects the configuration to live relative to the project root.

### Project-level

When creating a new Next.js project, a
[`next.config.<js|mjs>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/introduction) is
created, and _must_ exist in the project root. This allows each project to configure Next.js for
their needs.

```js title="<project>/next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  compress: true,
};
```
