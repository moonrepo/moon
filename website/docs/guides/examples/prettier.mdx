In this guide, you'll learn how to integrate [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) into moon.

Begin by installing `prettier` in your root. We suggest using the same version across the entire
repository.

<AddDepsTabs dep="prettier" dev />

## Setup

Since code formatting is a universal workflow, add a `format` task to
[`.moon/project.yml`](../../config/global-project) with the following parameters.

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml"
tasks:
	format:
		command:
			- 'prettier'
			# Use the same config for the entire repo
			- '--config'
			- '@in(4)'
			# Use the same ignore patterns as well
			- '--ignore-path'
			- '@in(3)'
			# Fail for unformatted code
			- '--check'
			# Run in current dir
			- '.'
		inputs:
			# Source and test files
			- 'src/**/*'
			- 'tests/**/*'
			# Config and other files
			- '**/*.{md,mdx,yml,yaml,json}'
			# Root configs, any format
			- '/.prettierignore'
			- '/.prettierrc.*'
```

## Configuration

### Root-level

The root-level Prettier config is _required_, as it defines conventions and standards to apply to
the entire repository.

```js title=".prettierrc.js"
module.exports = {
  arrowParens: 'always',
  semi: true,
  singleQuote: true,
  tabWidth: 2,
  trailingComma: 'all',
  useTabs: true,
};
```

The `.prettierignore` file must also be defined at the root, as
[only 1 ignore file](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html#ignoring-files-prettierignore) can
exist in a repository. We ensure this ignore file is used by passing `--ignore-path` above.

```bash title=".prettierignore"
node_modules/
*.min.js
*.map
*.snap
```

### Project-level

We suggest _against_ project-level configurations, as the entire repository should be formatted
using the same standards. However, if you're migrating code and need an escape hatch,
[overrides in the root](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html#configuration-overrides) will
work.

## FAQ

### How to use `--write`?

Unfortunately, this isn't currently possible, as the `prettier` binary itself requires either the
`--check` or `--write` options, and since we're configuring `--check` in the task above, that takes
precedence. This is also the preferred pattern as checks will run (and fail) in CI.

To work around this limitation, we suggest the following alternatives:

- Configure your editor to run Prettier on save.
- Define another task to write the formatted code, like `format-write`.
