Utilizing Deno in a TypeScript based monorepo can be a non-trivial task. With this handbook, we'll
help guide you through this process.

This guide is a living document and will continue to be updated over time!

## moon setup

For this part of the handbook, we'll be focusing on [moon](/moon), our task runner. To start,
languages in moon act like plugins, where their functionality and support _is not_ enabled unless
explicitly configured. We follow this approach to avoid unnecessary overhead.

### Enabling the language

To enable TypeScript support via Deno, define the [`deno`](../../config/toolchain#deno) setting in
[`.moon/toolchain.yml`](../../config/toolchain), even if an empty object.

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
# Enable Deno
deno: {}

# Enable Deno and override default settings
deno:
	lockfile: true
```

This will enable the Deno platform and provide the following automations around its ecosystem:

- Automatic handling and caching of lockfiles (when the setting is enabled).
- Relationships between projects will automatically be discovered based on `imports`, `importMap`,
  and `deps.ts` (currently experimental).
- And more to come!

### Work in progress

:::caution

Deno support is currently experimental while we finalize the implementation.

:::

The following features are not supported:

- `deno.jsonc` files (use `deno.json` instead).
- `npm:` imports do not consider Node.js dependencies as hash sources.
- `files.exclude` are currently considered an input. These will be filtered in a future release.

## Coming soon!

The handbook is currently being written while we finalize our Deno integration support!
