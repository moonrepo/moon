[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI
models to interact with external tools and services through a unified interface. The moon CLI
contains an MCP server that you can register with your code editor to allow LLMs to use moon
directly.

## Setup

### Cursor

To use MCP servers in Cursor, create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project directory, or
`~/.cursor/mcp.json` globally, with the following content:

```json title=".cursor/mcp.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moon": {
      "command": "moon",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once configured, the moon MCP server should appear in the "Available Tools" section on the MCP
settings page in Cursor.

### VS Code

To use MCP servers in VS Code, you must have the
[Copilot Chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat) extension installed.
Once installed, create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file with the following content:

```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
{
  "servers": {
    "moon": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "moon",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once your MCP server is configured, you can use it with
[GitHub Copilot’s agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode):

- Open the Copilot Chat view in VS Code
- Enable agent mode using the mode select dropdown
- Toggle on moon's MCP tools using the “Tools” button

## Available tools

The following tools are available in the moon MCP server and can be executed by LLMs using agent
mode.

- `get_project` - Get a project and its tasks by `id`.
- `get_projects` - Get all projects.
- `get_task` - Get a task by `target`.
- `get_tasks` - Get all tasks.

:::info

The
[request and response shapes](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/blob/master/packages/types/src/mcp.ts)
for these tools are defined as TypeScript types in the
[`@moonrepo/types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moonrepo/types) package.
