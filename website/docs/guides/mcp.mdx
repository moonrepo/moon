[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI
models to interact with external tools and services through a unified interface. The moon CLI
contains an MCP server that you can register with your code editor to allow LLMs to use moon
directly.

## Setup

### Cursor

To use [MCP servers in Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol), create a
`.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project directory, or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` globally, with the
following content:

```json title=".cursor/mcp.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moon": {
      "command": "moon",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MOON_WORKSPACE_ROOT": "/absolute/path/to/your/moon/workspace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Once configured, the moon MCP server should appear in the "Available Tools" section on the MCP
settings page in Cursor.

### VS Code

To use MCP servers in VS Code, you must have the
[Copilot Chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat) extension installed.
Once installed, create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file with the following content:

```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
{
  "servers": {
    "moon": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "moon",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MOON_WORKSPACE_ROOT": "${workspaceFolder}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Once your MCP server is configured, you can use it with
[GitHub Copilotâ€™s agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode):

- Open the Copilot Chat view in VS Code
- Enable agent mode using the mode select dropdown
- Toggle on moon's MCP tools using the "Tools" button

### Zed

To use [MCP servers in Zed](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/mcp), create a `.zed/settings.json` file in your
project directory, or `~/.config/zed/settings.json` globally, with the following content:

```json title=".zed/settings.json"
{
  "context_servers": {
    "moon": {
      "command": {
        "path": "moon",
        "args": ["mcp"],
        "env": {
          "MOON_WORKSPACE_ROOT": "/absolute/path/to/your/moon/workspace"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Once your MCP server is configured, you'll need to enable the tools using the following steps:

- Open the Agent panel in Zed
- Click the Write/Ask toggle button and go to "Configure Profiles"
- Click "Customize" in the Ask section
- Click "Configure MCP Tools"
- Enable each tool under the "moon" section

## Available tools

The following tools are available in the moon MCP server and can be executed by LLMs using agent
mode.

- `get_project` - Get a project and its tasks by `id`.
- `get_projects` - Get all projects.
- `get_task` - Get a task by `target`.
- `get_tasks` - Get all tasks.

:::info

The
[request and response shapes](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/blob/master/packages/types/src/mcp.ts)
for these tools are defined as TypeScript types in the
[`@moonrepo/types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moonrepo/types) package.
