Troubleshooting slow or unperformant tasks? Profile and diagnose them with ease!

> Profiling is only supported by Node.js based tasks, and is not supported by tasks that are created
> through `package.json` inferrence.

## CPU snapshots

CPU profiling helps you get a better understanding of which parts of your code require the most CPU
time, and how your code is executed and optimized by Node.js. The profiler will measure code
execution and activities performed by the engine itself, such as compilation, calls of system
libraries, optimization, and garbage collection.

### Record a profile

To record a CPU profile, pass `--profile cpu` to the [`moon run`](../commands/run) command. When
successful, the profile will be written to `.moon/cache/runs/<project>/<task>/snapshot.cpuprofile`.

```shell
$ moon run --profile cpu app:lint
```

### Analyze in Chrome

CPU profiles can be reviewed and analyzed with
[Chrome developer tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) using the following steps.

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://inspect`.
2. Under "Devices", navigate to "Open dedicated DevTools for Node".
3. The following window will popup. Ensure the "Profiler" tab is selected.

4. Click "Load" and select the `snapshot.cpuprofile` that was
   [previously recorded](#record-a-profile). If successful, the snapshot will appear in the left
   column.

> On macOS, press `command` + `shift` + `.` to display hidden files and folders, to locate the
> `.moon` folder.

5. Select the snapshot in the left column. From here, the snapshot can be analyzed and represented
   with [Bottom up](#bottom-up), [Top down](#top-down), or [Flame chart](#flame-chart) views.

## Heap snapshots

Heap profiling lets you detect memory leaks, dynamic memory problems, and locate the fragments of
code that caused them.

### Record a profile

To record a heap profile, pass `--profile heap` to the [`moon run`](../commands/run) command. When
successful, the profile will be written to `.moon/cache/runs/<project>/<task>/snapshot.heapprofile`.

```shell
$ moon run --profile heap app:lint
```

### Analyze in Chrome

Heap profiles can be reviewed and analyzed with
[Chrome developer tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) using the following steps.

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://inspect`.
2. Under "Devices", navigate to "Open dedicated DevTools for Node".
3. The following window will popup. Ensure the "Memory" tab is selected.

<Image src={require('./profile/heap.png')} alt="DevTools Profiler - Heap" />

4. Click "Load" and select the `snapshot.heapprofile` that was
   [previously recorded](#record-a-profile-1). If successful, the snapshot will appear in the left
   column.

> On macOS, press `command` + `shift` + `.` to display hidden files and folders, to locate the
> `.moon` folder.

   with [Bottom up](#bottom-up), [Top down](#top-down), or [Flame chart](#flame-chart) views.

## Views

Chrome DevTools provide 3 views for analyzing activities within a snapshot. Each view gives you a
different perspective on these activities.

### Bottom up

The Bottom up view is helpful if you encounter a heavy function and want to find out where it was
called from.

- The "Self Time" column represents the aggregated time spent directly in that activity, across all
  of its occurrences.
- The "Total Time" column represents aggregated time spent in that activity or any of its children.
- The "Function" column is the function that was executed, including source location, and any
  children.

### Top down

The Top down view works in a similar fashion to [Bottom up](#bottom-up), but displays functions
starting from the top-level entry points. These are also known as root activities.

### Flame chart

DevTools represents main thread activity with a flame chart. The x-axis represents the recording
over time. The y-axis represents the call stack. The events on top cause the events below it.
