Is your CI pipeline running slower than usual? Are you tired of running the same build over and over
although nothing has changed? Do you wish to reuse the same local cache across other machines and
environments? These are just a few scenarios that remote caching aims to solve.

Remote caching is a system that shares artifacts to improve performance, reduce unnecessary
computation time, and alleviate resources. It achieves this by uploading hashed artifacts to a cloud
storage provider, like AWS S3 or Google Cloud, and downloading them on demand when a build matches a
derived hash.

To make use of remote caching, we provide 2 solutions.

## Self-hosted (unstable)<VersionLabel version="1.30.0" />

This solution allows you to host any remote caching service that is compatible with the
[Bazel Remote Execution v2 API](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis/tree/main/build/bazel/remote/execution/v2),
such as [`bazel-remote`](https://github.com/buchgr/bazel-remote). When using this solution, the
following RE API features must be enabled:

- Action result caching
- Content addressable storage caching
- SHA256 digest hashing
- gRPC requests

:::warning

This feature and its implementation is currently unstable, and its documentation is incomplete.
Please report any issues on GitHub or through Discord!

### Host your service

When you have chosen (or built) a compatible service, host it and make it available through gRPC (we
do not support HTTP at this time). For example, if you plan to use `bazel-remote`, you can do
something like the following:

```bash
bazel-remote --dir /path/to/moon-cache --max_size 10 --storage_mode uncompressed --grpc_address 0.0.0.0:9092
```

:::info

View the official [`bazel-remote`](https://github.com/buchgr/bazel-remote#usage) documentation for
all the available options, like storing artifacts in S3, configuring authentication (TLS/mTLS),
proxies, and more.

:::

### Configure remote caching

Once your service is running, you can enable remote caching by configuring the
[`unstable_remote`](../config/workspace#unstable_remote) settings in
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](../config/workspace). At minimum, the only setting that is required is
`host`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
unstable_remote:
  host: 'grpc://your-host.com:9092'
```

#### TLS and mTLS

We have rudimentary support for TLS and mTLS, but it's very unstable, and has not been thoroughly
tested. There's also [many](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/issues/1652)
[many](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/issues/1989)
[issues](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/issues/1033) around authentication in Tonic.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
# TLS
unstable_remote:
  host: 'grpcs://your-host.com:9092'
  tls:
    cert: 'certs/ca.pem'
    domain: 'your-host.com'

# mTLS
unstable_remote:
  host: 'grpcs://your-host.com:9092'
  mtls:
    caCert: 'certs/ca.pem'
    clientCert: 'certs/client.pem'
    clientKey: 'certs/client.key'
    domain: 'your-host.com'
```

## Cloud-hosted: moonbase<VersionLabel version="0.23.3" />

This solution utilizes our [moonbase](/moonbase) service, which is a SaaS cloud offering hosted and
managed by us. This is also known as third-party hosting.

### Sign up for an account

Remote caching requires a [moonrepo.app](https://moonrepo.app) account. Creating an account requires
a GitHub account. In the future we'll support additional OAuth providers.

#### Create an organization

A moonbase organization can represent a company, team, group, or personal workspace, and is required
for housing repositories, projects, artifacts, and more. Begin by creating an organization from the
dashboard.

> The "Region" field is very important for remote caching, as it configures which S3 region to store
> artifacts in. This _cannot_ be changed after creation, so choose wisely!

#### Create a repository

A moonbase repository is a direct relationship to a codebase repository, and is necessary for
linking artifacts to the appropriate tasks. From an organization's page, you can create a
repository.

> The "Slug" field must match your repository's "remote/repo" naming exactly, as we compare these
> values for authentication purposes.

### Enabling remote caching

Once you have a [moonrepo.app](https://moonrepo.app) account, an organization, and repository, you
can enable remote caching in your CI pipeline. From a moonbase organization page, you can view your
API key in the actions menu.

In a repository's CI environment, set the following environment variable.

```
MOONBASE_SECRET_KEY=<secret key>
```

moon will automatically authenticate the remote caching service when credentials in the environment
exist. Furthermore, the repository in question must be within the moonbase organization, and the
repository slug (`<owner>/<repo>`) must match.

## FAQ

#### What is an artifact?

In the context of moon and remote caching, an artifact is the
[outputs of a task](../config/project#outputs), a tar archive (`.tar.gz`) that contains all these
outputs, as well as the stdout and stderr of the task that generated the outputs. Artifacts are
uniquely identified by the [moon generated hash](../concepts/cache#hashing).

#### Do I have to use remote caching?

No, remote caching is _optional_. It's intended purpose is to store long lived build artifacts to
speed up CI pipelines, and optionally local development. For the most part,
[`moon ci`](../commands/ci) does a great job of only running what's affected in pull requests, and
is a great starting point.

#### Does remote caching store source code?

No, remote caching _does not_ store source code. It stores the
[outputs of a task](../config/project#outputs), which is typically built and compiled code. To
verify this, you can inspect the tar archives in `.moon/cache/outputs`.

#### Does moon collect any personally identifiable information?

No, moon does not collect any PII as part of the remote caching process.

However, to use [moonbase](/moonbase) remote caching, you must create a moonrepo account in which we
require an email address, and information about your organization and repository.

#### Are artifacts encrypted?

For [moonbase](/moonbase), yes! We use AWS's built-in SSE-S3 encryption for all S3 buckets. For
self-hosted services, encryption is up to you.
