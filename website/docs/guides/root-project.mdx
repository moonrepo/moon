title: Root-level project

<VersionLabel header version="0.9" />

Coming from other repositories or task runner, you may be familiar with tasks available at the
repository root, in which one-off, organization, maintenance, or process oriented tasks can be ran.
moon supports this through a concept known as a root-level project.

Begin by adding the root to [`projects`](../config/workspace#projects) with a source value of `.`
(current directory relative from the workspace).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
# As a map
projects:
  root: '.'

# As a list of globs
projects:
  - '.'
```

> When using globs, the root project's name will be inferred from the repository folder name. Be
> wary of this as it can change based on what a developer has checked out as.

Once added, create a [`moon.yml`](../config/project) in the root of the repository. From here you
can define tasks that can be ran using this new root-level project name, for example,
`moon run root:<task>`.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
	versionCheck:
		command: 'yarn version check'
		inputs: []
		options:
			cache: false
```

And that's it, but there are a few caveats to be aware of...

## Caveats

### Greedy inputs

Task [`inputs`](../config/project#inputs) default to `**/*`, which would result in root-level tasks
scanning _all_ files in the repository. This will be a very expensive operation! We suggest
restricting inputs to a very succinct whitelist, or disabling inputs entirely.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
	oneOff:
		# ...
		inputs: []
```

### Inherited tasks

Because a root project is still a project in the workspace, it will inherit all tasks defined in
[`.moon/tasks.yml`](../config/tasks), which may be unexpected. To mitigate this, you can exclude
some or all of these tasks in the root config with
[`workspace.inheritedTasks`](../config/project#inheritedtasks).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
workspace:
	inheritedTasks:
		include: []
```
