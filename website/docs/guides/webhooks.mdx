Looking to gather metrics for your pipelines? Gain insight into run durations and failures? Maybe
you want to send Slack or Discord notifications? With our webhooks, all of these are possible!

When the [`notifier.webhookUrl`](../config/workspace#webhookurl) setting is configured with an HTTPS
URL, and moon is running in a CI environment, moon will POST a payload to this endpoint for every
event in our pipeline.

## Payload structure

Every webhook event is posted with the following request body, known as a payload.

- `type` (`string`) - The type of [event](#events).
- `environment` (`object | null`) - Information about the current CI/CD pipeline environment.
- `event` (`object`) - The event specific payload. View each event for an example of their
  structure.
- `createdAt` (`string`) - When the event was created, as a UTC timestamp in ISO 8601 (RFC 3339)
  format.
- `uuid` (`string`) - A unique identifier for all webhooks in the current run batch.

```json
{
  "type": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    // ...
  },
  "createdAt": "...",
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

> The `uuid` field can be used to differentiate concurrently running pipelines!

### Pipeline environment

When webhooks are sent from a CI/CD pipeline, we attempt to include information about the
environment under the `environment` field. If information could not be detected, this field is null,
otherwise it contains these fields.

- `baseBranch` (`string | null`) - When a merge/pull request, the target (base) branch, otherwise
  null.
- `branch` (`string`) - When a merge/pull request, the source (head) branch, otherwise the
  triggering branch.
- `id` (`string`) - ID of the current pipeline instance.
- `provider` (`string`) - Name of your CI/CD provider. GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI, etc.
- `requestId` (`string | null`) - The ID of the merge/pull request.
- `requestUrl` (`string | null`) - Link to the merge/pull request.
- `revision` (`string`) - The HEAD commit, revision, tag, ref, etc, that triggered the pipeline.
- `url` (`string | null`) - Link to the current pipeline, when available.

## Events

### Pipeline

Runs actions within moon using a robust dependency graph. Is triggered when using
[`moon run`](../commands/run).

### `pipeline.started`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadPipelineStarted" />

Triggered when the pipeline has been created but before actions have started to run.

This event includes the number of actions registered within the pipeline, but does not provide
detailed information about the actions. Use the [`action.*`](#actionstarted) events for this.

```json
{
  "type": "pipeline.started",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "actionsCount": 15
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### `pipeline.finished`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadPipelineFinished" />

Triggered when the pipeline has finished running all actions, with aggregated counts based on final
status.

This event is _not_ triggered if the pipeline crashes (this does not include actions that have
failed, as those are legitimate runs). Use the [`pipeline.aborted`](#pipelineaborted) event if you
want to also catch crashes.

```json
{
  "type": "pipeline.finished",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "cachedCount": 10,
    "duration": {
      "secs": 120,
      "nanos": 3591693
    },
    "failedCount": 1,
    "passedCount": 4
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### `pipeline.aborted`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadPipelineAborted" />

Triggered when the pipeline has crashed for unknown reasons, or had to abort as a result of a
critical action failing.

```json
{
  "type": "pipeline.aborted",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "error": "..."
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### Actions

Actions are "jobs" within the pipeline that are executed topologically.

### `action.started`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadActionStarted" />

Triggered when an action within the pipeline has started to run.

```json
{
  "type": "action.started",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "action": {
      "attempts": null,
      "createdAt": "...",
      "duration": {
        "secs": 0,
        "nanos": 3591693
      },

      "nodeIndex": 5,
      "status": "passed"
    },
    "node": {
      "action": "InstallDeps",
      "params": [
        {
          "platform": "Node",
          "version": "18.0.0"

    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### `action.finished`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadActionFinished" />

Triggered when an action within the pipeline has finished running, either with a success or failure.
If the action failed, the `error` field will be set with the error message.

```json
{
  "type": "action.finished",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "action": {

Installed deps can be scoped with the `InstallDeps(...)` labels.

```json
{
  "type": "dependencies.installed",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "error": null,
    "project": null,
    "runtime": {
      "platform": "Node",
      "version": "18.0.0"
    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### `project.syncing`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadProjectSyncing" />

    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### `tool.installing`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadToolInstalling" />

Triggered when a tool within the toolchain has started downloading and installing.

This event is _always_ triggered, regardless of whether the tool has already been installed or not.
For an accurate state, use the [`action.finished`](#actionfinished) event. If the `status` is
"skipped", then the tool was already installed.

```json
{
  "type": "tool.installing",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "runtime": {
      "platform": "Node",

    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### `tool.installed`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadToolInstalled" />

Triggered when a tool within the toolchain has finished installing. If the install failed, the
`error` field will be set with the error message.

For more information about the action, refer to the [`action.finished`](#actionfinished) event.
Tools can be scoped with the `SetupTool(...)` labels.

```json

  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### `target.running`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadTargetRunning" />

Triggered when a [target](../concepts/target) has started to run (via
[`moon run`](../commands/run)).

```json
{
  "type": "target.running",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "target": "app:build"
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### `target.ran`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadTargetRan" />

Triggered when a [target](../concepts/target) has finished running. If the run failed, the `error`
field will be set with the error message.

For more information about the action, refer to the [`action.finished`](#actionfinished) event. Ran
targets can be scoped with the `RunTarget(...)` labels.

```json
{
  "type": "target.ran",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "error": null,
    "target": "app:build"
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### Targets

Targets to run. Each event contains a `hash` field, that is a unique SHA-256 identifier for the the
target's hashed contents.

### `target-output.cache-check`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadTargetOutputCacheCheck" />

Triggered when the pipeline is checking for a cached archive of the currently running target.

```json
{
  "type": "target-output.cache-check",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "hash": "1f5205cdb0912e97190e08a6cf98e41804bf6824b0a325d315e8b488a12677b0",
    "target": "app:build"
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### `target-output.archiving`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadTargetOutputArchiving" />

Triggered when the [outputs](../config/project#outputs) of a task are being cached into a tarball
archive. This archive will be stored within `.moon/cache/outputs` on the host machine.

This event _does not_ trigger if the task has no `outputs`.

```json
{
  "type": "target-output.archiving",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "hash": "1f5205cdb0912e97190e08a6cf98e41804bf6824b0a325d315e8b488a12677b0",
    "project": {
      "id": "app"
      // ...
    },
    "target": "app:build",
    "task": {
      "id": "build"
      // ...
    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### `target-output.archived`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadTargetOutputArchived" />

Triggered when the [outputs](../config/project#outputs) of a task have been archived and stored in
the `.moon/cache/outputs` directory. The `archivePath` field is an absolute path to this archive,
_but_ is unique to the host machine that the target ran on.

This event _does not_ trigger if [`target-output.archiving`](#targetoutputarchiving) did not run or
failed to run.

```json
{
  "type": "target-output.archived",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "archivePath": "...",
    "hash": "1f5205cdb0912e97190e08a6cf98e41804bf6824b0a325d315e8b488a12677b0",
    "project": {
      "id": "app"
      // ...
    },
    "target": "app:build",
    "task": {
      "id": "build"
      // ...
    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### `target-output.hydrating`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadTargetOutputHydrating" />

Triggered when a target has a cache hit for the generated hash (a cached archive exists on the local
file system) and the archive is being unpacked into the project directory at the defined
[outputs](../config/project#outputs).

This event _does not_ trigger if the task has no `outputs`, or there was a cache miss (no matching
archive).

```json
{
  "type": "target-output.hydrating",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "hash": "1f5205cdb0912e97190e08a6cf98e41804bf6824b0a325d315e8b488a12677b0",
    "project": {
      "id": "app"
      // ...
    },
    "target": "app:build",
    "task": {
      "id": "build"
      // ...
    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### `target-output.hydrated`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadTargetOutputHydrated" />

Triggered when a target has hydrated a project with the contents of a cached archive. The
`archivePath` field is an absolute path to this archive, _but_ is unique to the host machine that
the target ran on.

This event _does not_ trigger if [`target-output.hydrating`](#targetoutputhydrating) did not run or
failed to run.

```json
{
  "type": "target-output.hydrated",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "environment": "...",
  "event": {
    "archivePath": "...",
    "hash": "1f5205cdb0912e97190e08a6cf98e41804bf6824b0a325d315e8b488a12677b0",
    "project": {
      "id": "app"
      // ...
    },
    "target": "app:build",
    "task": {
      "id": "build"
      // ...
    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```
