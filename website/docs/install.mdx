The following guide can be used to install moon and integrate it into an existing repository (with
or without incremental adoption), or to a fresh repository.

## Installing

The entirety of moon is packaged and shipped as a single binary. It works on all major operating
systems, and does not require any external dependencies. For convenience, we provide the following
scripts to download and install moon.

### Linux, macOS, WSL

In a terminal that supports Bash, run:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://moonrepo.dev/install/moon.sh | bash
```

This will install moon to `~/.moon/bin` and create a symlink in `/usr/local/bin`. If the symlink
fails, you'll need to set the `PATH` manually in your shell.

```shell
export PATH="$HOME/.moon/bin:$PATH"
```

### Windows

In Powershell or Windows Terminal, run:

```shell
irm https://moonrepo.dev/install/moon.ps1 | iex
```

This will install moon to `~\.moon\bin` and prepend to the `PATH` environment variable for the
current session. To persist across sessions, update `PATH` manually.

### proto

moon can be installed and managed in [proto's toolchain](/proto) using a TOML plugin. This will
install moon to `~/.proto/tools/moon` and make the binary available at `~/.proto/bin`.

```toml title=".prototools"
[plugins]
moon = "source:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonrepo/moon/master/proto-plugin.toml"
```

```shell
proto install moon
```

Furthermore, the version of moon can be pinned on a per-project basis using the `.prototools` file.

```toml title=".prototools"
moon = "1.3.0"
```

### Node.js

moon is also packaged and shipped as a single binary through the
[`@moonrepo/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moonrepo/cli) npm package. Begin by installing this
package at the root of the repository. This is also useful in _pinning the exact version_ the
repository should be using.

<AddDepsTabs dep="@moonrepo/cli" dev />

### Other

moon can also be downloaded and installed manually, by downloading an asset from
[https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases). Be sure to
rename the file after downloading, and apply the executable bit (`chmod +x`) on macOS and Linux.

## Upgrading

moon can be upgraded with the [`moon upgrade`](./commands/upgrade) command. However, this will only
upgrade moon if it was installed in `~/.moon/bin`.

```shell
moon upgrade
```

Otherwise, you can re-run the installers above and it will download, install, and overwrite with the
latest version.
