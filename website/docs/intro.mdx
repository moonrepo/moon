moon is a repository *m*anagement, *o*rganization, *o*rchestration, and *n*otification tool for the
web ecosystem, written in Rust. Many of the concepts within moon are heavily inspired from Bazel and
other popular build systems, but tailored for our [supported languages](#supported-languages).

## Why use moon?

Working in a language's ecosystem can be very involved, especially when it comes to managing a
repository effectively. Which language version to use? Which dependency manager to use? How to use
packages? Or how to build packages? So on and so forth. moon aims to streamline this entire process
and provide a first-class developer experience.

- **Increased productivity** - With [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as our foundation, we can
  ensure robust speeds, high performance, and low memory usage. Instead of long builds blocking you,
  focus on your work.
- **Exceptional developer experience** - As veterans of developer tooling, we're well aware of the
  pain points and frustrations. Our goal is to mitigate and overcome these obstacles.
- **Incremental adoption** - At its core, moon has been designed to be adopted incrementally and is
  _not_ an "all at once adoption". Migrate project-by-project, or task-by-task, it's up to you!
- **Reduced tasks confusion** - Tasks (for example, `package.json` scripts) can become unwieldy,
  very quickly. No more duplicating the same task into every project, or reverse-engineering which
  root scripts to use. With moon, all you need to know is the project name, and a task name.
- **Ensure correct versions** - Whether it's a programming language or dependency manager, ensure
  the same version of each tool is the same across _every_ developer's environment. No more wasted
  hours of debugging.
- **Automation built-in** - When applicable, moon will automatically install dependencies
  (`node_modules`), or
  [sync project dependencies](/docs/config/toolchain#syncprojectworkspacedependencies), or even
  [sync TypeScript project references](/docs/config/toolchain#syncprojectreferences).
- And of course, the amazing list of [features](#features) below!

## Supported languages

moon's long-term vision is to robustly support multiple programming languages (and dependency
managers) so that a repository composed of projects with differing languages and tools can all work
in unison. This is a lofty vision that requires a massive amount of time and resources to achieve,
and as such, is not available on initial release, but will gradually be supported over time.

To help achieve this vision, language support is broken down into 4 tiers, allowing us to
incremental integrate and improve them over time. The 4 tiers are as follows:

- &nbsp;<Label text="Tier 0" variant="failure" /> &nbsp; **No direct integration** - Tool is not
  directly supported in moon, but can still be ran using the
  ["system" task platform](/docs/faq#can-we-run-other-languages), which expects the tool to exist in
  the current environment.
- &nbsp;<Label text="Tier 1" variant="warning" /> &nbsp; **Project categorization** - Projects can
  configure their primary [language in `moon.yml`](/docs/config/project#language).
- &nbsp;<Label text="Tier 2" variant="info" /> &nbsp; **Ecosystem platformization** - moon deeply
  integrates with the language's ecosystem by parsing manifests, lockfiles, and other semantic files
  to infer dependencies, tasks, and other necessary information.
- &nbsp;<Label text="Tier 3" variant="success" /> &nbsp; **Toolchain integration** - Language is
  directly supported in the toolchain, configured in
  [`.moon/toolchain.yml`](/docs/config/toolchain), and will automatically be downloaded and
  installed.

## Supported targets

Because moon is written in Rust, we only support targets that are explicitly compiled for, which are
currently:
