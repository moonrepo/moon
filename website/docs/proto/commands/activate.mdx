<VersionLabel version="0.38.0" header />

The `proto activate <shell>` command will activate proto for the current shell session, by exporting
environment variables and prepending `PATH` for each tool configured in the current directory.
Activation is ran each time the current directory changes using a shell hook.

:::info

Learn more about
[shell activation in the official workflow documentation](../workflows#shell-activation)!

:::

### Arguments

- `<shell>` - The shell to activate for.

### Options

- `--export` - Print the activate instructions in shell-specific syntax.
- `--json` - Print the activate instructions in JSON format.
- `--no-bin` - Do not include `~/.proto/bin` when appending `PATH`.
- `--no-shim` - Do not include `~/.proto/shims` when prepending `PATH`.
- `--on-init` - Trigger activation when initialized in the shell, instead of waiting for a cd/prompt
  change. <VersionLabel version="0.43.0" />

### Caveats

- Only tools that have a [version configured in `.prototools`](../config#pinning-versions) will be
  activated.
- Tool versions configured in the global `~/.proto/.prototools` are _not_ included by default. Pass
  `--config-mode all` during activation to include them.
  - Do note that this will worsen performance depending on the number of tools.
- Activation is only applied _after changing directories_ and not when a new shell session is
  started, unless the `--on-init` argument is passed.

### Setup

The following activation steps should be added _after_ all environment variable and `PATH`
modifications have happened in your shell, typically at the end of your shell profile.

:::warning

Any `PATH` modifications _after_ `proto activate` will be lost when activation triggers. This
happens because we take a snapshot of `PATH` when executed from your shell, and reset `PATH` on each
activation to the snapshot. To avoid this problem, modify `PATH` before `proto activate`.

:::

#### Bash

Add the following line to the end of your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`.

```shell
eval "$(proto activate bash)"
```

#### Elvish

Generate the hook:

```shell
proto activate elvish > ~/.elvish/lib/proto-hook.elv
```

Then add the following line to your `~/.elvish/rc.elv` file.

```shell
use proto-hook
```

#### Fish

Add the following line to the end of your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.

```shell
proto activate fish | source
```

#### Murex

Add the following line to the end of your `~/.murex_profile`.

```shell
proto activate murex -> source
```

#### Nu

Generate the hook:

```shell
(proto activate nu) | save ~/.config/nushell/proto-hook.nu
```

Then add the following line to your `~/.config/nushell/config.nu` file.

```shell
use proto-hook.nu
```

#### Pwsh

Add the following line to the end of your profile (`$PROFILE`).

```shell
proto activate pwsh | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

#### Zsh

Add the following line to the end of your `~/.zshrc`.

```shell
eval "$(proto activate zsh)"
```
