title: install
---

The `proto install <tool>` command will download and install a tool by unpacking their archive to
`~/.proto/tools/<tool>`. If the tool has already been installed, the command will exit early.

The command is also smart enough to resolve partial versions, so 1, 1.2, and 1.2.3 are all
acceptable. It even supports aliases when applicable, like `latest`, `next`, `beta`, etc.

```shell
$ proto install deno 1.31
```

### Arguments

- `<tool>` - Type of tool.
- `[version]` - Version of tool. Defaults to "latest".
