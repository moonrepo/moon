The `proto local <tool> <version>` command will set the local version of a tool by creating a
`.prototools` file (if it does not exist) in the current working directory with the appropriate tool
and version. This version will be used when attempting to [detect a version](../detection).

```shell
$ proto local go 1.20.1
```

> [Learn more about the `.prototools` configuration file!](../config)
