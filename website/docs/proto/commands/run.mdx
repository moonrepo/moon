The `proto run <tool>` command will run a tool after [detecting a version](../detection) from the
environment.

```shell
# Run and detect version from environment
$ proto run bun

# Run with explicit version
$ proto run bun 0.5.3

# Run with version from environment variable
$ PROTO_BUN_VERSION=0.5.3 proto run bun
```

Arguments can be passed to the underlying tool binary by providing additional arguments after `--`.

```shell
$ proto run bun -- run ./script.ts

# When using the binary on PATH
$ bun run ./script.ts
```

### Arguments

- `<tool>` - Type of tool.
- `[version]` - Version of tool. If not provided, will attempt to detect the version from the
  environment.
