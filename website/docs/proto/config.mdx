import VersionLabel from '@site/src/components/Docs/VersionLabel';

We support configuration at both the project-level and user-level using a
[TOML](https://toml.io/en/) based `.prototools` file. This file can be used to pin versions of
tools, provide tool specific configuration, enable new tools via plugins, define proto settings, and
more.

## Resolution mode<VersionLabel version="0.40.0" />

When a `proto` command or shim is ran, we must find and load all applicable `.prototools` files. We
then deeply merge all of these configuration files into a final configuration object, with the
current directory taking highest precedence.

The order in which to resolve configuration can be defined using the `--config-mode` (`-c`) command
line option, or the `PROTO_CONFIG_MODE` environment variable. The following 4 modes are supported:

### `global`

In this mode, proto will _only_ load the `~/.proto/.prototools` file. This "global" file acts as
configuration at the user-level and allows for fallback settings.

```text
~/.proto/.prototools
```

### `local`

In this mode, proto will _only_ load the `.prototools` file in the current directory.

```text
./.prototools
```

### `upwards`

In this mode, proto will traverse upwards starting from the current directory, and load
`.prototools` within each directory, until we reach the system root or the user directory (`~`),
whichever comes first.

```text
~/Projects/app/.prototools (cwd)
~/Projects/.prototools
~/.prototools
```

> This is the default mode for the [`activate`](./commands/activate),
> [`install`](./commands/install), [`outdated`](./commands/outdated), and
> [`status`](./commands/status) commands.

### `upwards-global` / `all`

This mode works exactly like [`upwards`](#upwards) but with the functionality of [`global`](#global)
as well. The global `~/.proto/.prototools` file is appended as the final entry.

```text
~/Projects/app/.prototools (cwd)
~/Projects/.prototools
~/.prototools
~/.proto/.prototools
```

> This is the default mode for all other commands not listed above in `upwards`.

## Environment mode<VersionLabel version="0.29.0" />

We also support environment specific configuration, such as `.prototools.production` or
`.prototools.development`, when the `PROTO_ENV` environment variable is set. This is useful for
defining environment specific aliases, or tool specific configuration.

These environment aware settings take precedence over the default `.prototools` file, for the
directory it's located in, and are merged in the same way as the default configuration. For example,
the lookup order would be the following when `PROTO_ENV=production`:

```text
~/Projects/.prototools.production
~/Projects/.prototools
~/.prototools.production
~/.prototools
~/.proto/.prototools
```

> The global `~/.proto/.prototools` file does not support environment modes.

## Pinning versions

proto supports pinning versions of tools on a per-directory basis through our `.prototools`
configuration file. This file takes precedence during [version detection](./detection) and can be
created/updated with [`proto pin`](./commands/pin).

At its most basic level, you can map tools to specific versions, for the directory the file is
located in. A [version](./version-spec) can either be a fully-qualified version, a partial version,
a range or requirement, or an alias.

```toml title=".prototools"
node = "16.16.0"
npm = "9"
go = "~1.20"
rust = "stable"
```

### Lock `proto` version<VersionLabel version="0.39.0" />

You can also pin the version of proto that you want all tools to execute with by adding a `proto`
version entry. This entry _does not_ support partial versions and _must_ contain a fully-qualified
semantic version.

```toml title=".prototools"
proto = "0.38.0"
```

Locking is currently enforced through [`proto activate`](./commands/activate), and when activated,
all shims (tools) will be executed with that explicit version of proto. This _does not_ apply to the
version of proto globally installed (in some situations), or for binaries linked in `~/.proto/bin`.

## Available settings

### `[env]`<VersionLabel version="0.29.0" />

This setting is a map of environment variables that will be applied to _all_ tools when they are
executed, or when [`proto activate`](./commands/activate) is ran in a shell profile. Variables
defined here _will not_ override existing environment variables (either passed on the command line,
or inherited from the shell).

```toml title=".prototools"
[env]
DEBUG = "*"
```

Additionally, `false` can be provided as a value, which will _remove_ the environment variable. This
is useful for removing inherited shell variables.

```toml title=".prototools"
[env]
DEBUG = false
```

Variables also support substitution using the syntax `${VAR_NAME}`. When using substitution,
variables in the current process and merged `[env]` can be referenced. Recursive substitution is not
supported!

> This functionality enables per-directory environment variables!

### `[settings]`

#### `auto-install`

When enabled, will automatically installing missing tools when [`proto run`](./commands/run) is ran,
instead of erroring. Defaults to `false` or `PROTO_AUTO_INSTALL`.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings]
auto-install = true
```

#### `auto-clean`

When enabled, will automatically clean up the proto store in the background, by removing unused
tools and outdated plugins. Defaults to `false` or `PROTO_AUTO_CLEAN`.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings]
auto-clean = true
```

#### `builtin-plugins`<VersionLabel version="0.39.0" />

Can be used to customize the [built-in plugins](./tools#built-in) within proto. Can disable all
built-ins by passing `false`, or enabling a select few by name. Defaults to `true`, which enables
all.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings]
# Disable all
builtin-plugins = false
# Enable some
builtin-plugins = ["node", "bun"]
```

#### `detect-strategy`

The strategy to use when [detecting versions](./detection). Defaults to `first-available` or
`PROTO_DETECT_STRATEGY`.

- `first-available` - Will use the first available version that is found. Either from `.prototools`
  or a tool specific file (`.nvmrc`, etc).
- `prefer-prototools` - Prefer a `.prototools` version, even if found in a parent directory. If none
  found, falls back to tool specific file.
- `only-prototools` - Only use a version defined in `.prototools`. <VersionLabel version="0.34.0" />

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings]
detect-strategy = "prefer-prototools"
```

#### `pin-latest`

When defined and a tool is installed with the "latest" version, will automatically pin the resolved
version to the configured location. Defaults to disabled or `PROTO_PIN_LATEST`.

- `global` - Pins globally to `~/.proto/.prototools`.
- `local` - Pins locally to `.prototools` in current directory.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings]
pin-latest = "local"
```

#### `telemetry`

When enabled, we collect anonymous usage statistics for tool installs and uninstalls. This helps us
prioritize which tools to support, what tools or their versions may be broken, the plugins currently
in use, and more. Defaults to `true`.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings]
telemetry = false
```

> The data we track is publicly available and
> [can be found here](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/blob/master/legacy/cli/src/telemetry.rs).

### `[settings.http]`

Can be used to customize the HTTP client used by proto, primarily for requesting files to download,
available versions, and more.

#### `allow-invalid-certs`

When enabled, will allow invalid certificates instead of failing. This is an _escape hatch_ and
should only be used if other settings have failed. Be sure you know what you're doing! Defaults to
`false`.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings.http]
allow-invalid-certs = true
```

#### `proxies`

A list of proxy URLs to use for requests. As an alternative, the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable
can be set.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings.http]
proxies = ["https://internal.proxy", "https://corp.net/proxy"]
```

#### `root-cert`

The path to a root certificate to use for requests. This is useful for overriding the native
certificate, or for using a self-signed certificate, especially when in a corporate/internal
environment. Supports `pem` and `der` files.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings.http]
root-cert = "/path/to/root/cert.pem"
```

### `[plugins]`

Additional [plugins](./plugins) can be configured with the `[plugins]` section.
[Learn more about this syntax](./plugins#enabling-plugins).

```toml title=".prototools"
[plugins]
my-tool = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/my/tool/master/proto-plugin.toml"
```

Once configured, you can run a plugin as if it was a built-in tool:

```shell
$ proto install my-tool
```

## Tool specific settings

### `[tools.*]`

Tools support custom configuration that will be passed to their WASM plugin, which can be used to
control the business logic within the plugin. Please refer to the [official documentation](./tools)
of each tool (typically on their repository) for a list of available settings.

As an example, let's configure [Node.js](https://github.com/moonrepo/node-plugin) (using the `node`
identifier).

```toml title=".prototools"
npm = "bundled" # use bundled npm instead of specific version

[tools.node]
bundled-npm = true

[tools.npm]
shared-globals-dir = true
```

### `[tools.*.aliases]`

Aliases are custom and unique labels that map to a specific version, and can be configured manually
within `.prototools`, or by calling the [`proto alias`](./commands/alias) command.

```toml title=".prototools"
[tools.node.aliases]
work = "18"
oss = "20"
```

### `[tools.*.env]`<VersionLabel version="0.29.0" />

This setting is a map of environment variables for a specific tool, and will be applied when that
tool is executed, or when [`proto activate`](./commands/activate) is ran in a shell profile. These
variables will override those defined in `[env]`. Refer to [`[env]`](#env) for usage examples.

```toml title=".prototools"
[tools.node.env]
NODE_ENV = "production"
```

## GitHub Action

To streamline GitHub CI workflows, we provide the
[`moonrepo/setup-toolchain`](https://github.com/moonrepo/setup-toolchain) action, which can be used
to install `proto` globally, and cache the toolchain found at `~/.proto`.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
# ...
jobs:
  ci:
    name: 'CI'
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
      - uses: 'actions/checkout@v4'
      - uses: 'moonrepo/setup-toolchain@v0'
        with:
          auto-install: true
```
