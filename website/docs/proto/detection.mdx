The most powerful feature in proto is its contextual version detection, that is triggered with
[`proto run`](./commands/run), [`proto bin`](./commands/bin), or when a shim is executed. So what
does this mean exactly? Before a tool in proto's toolchain can be executed, we need to determine the
version of the tool to execute with. If a detected version exists locally, we proceed using that
binary, otherwise we fail with a missing installation error.

## Detection order

When detecting a version, the following steps are checked, in the order as listed:

#### 1. Version is explicitly passed as a command line argument

```
$ proto run node 18.0.0
```

#### 2. Version is provided with the `PROTO_*_VERSION` environment variable

```
$ PROTO_NODE_VERSION=18.0.0 proto run node
```

#### 3. Version is located by traversing the file system

This step will attempt to find a configuration or manifest file in the current working directory,
and traverse upwards through parent directories until a file is found.

##### 3.1. Version is defined locally in `.prototools`

A `.prototools` file was found and a version entry exists for the current tool. This is also known
as a "local version" and can be created with [`proto local`](./commands/local).

```toml title=".prototools"
node = "18.0.0"
```

##### 3.2. Version is defined in the tool's ecosystem

Depending on the tool, a version is extracted from a found file unique to that tool's ecosystem.
This includes version manager configs (`.nvmrc`, etc), manifest files (`package.json`, etc), and
more.

```text title=".nvmrc"
18.0.0
```

#### 4. Version is defined globally

As the last check, we look for a "global version" that was pinned with
[`proto global`](./commands/global).

```text title="~/.proto/tools/node/version"
18.0.0
```

#### 5. Version _could not_ be detected

If all the previous steps have failed, then we could not detect an applicable version, and the
process will fail.

## Language lookups

The following language files are checked when attempting to detect a version.

### Deno

- A [`.dvmrc`](https://github.com/justjavac/dvm) file.

### Go

- Native [`go.work`](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces) or
  [`go.mod`](https://go.dev/doc/modules/gomod-ref) files.

### Node.js

- The [`engines`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#engines) field in
  `package.json` _(only explicit/fixed versions)_.
- The `packageManager` field in `package.json` for package managers.
- An [`.nvmrc`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or
  [`.node-version`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) file.
