## General

### Where did the name "proto" come from?

We wanted to keep with the space theme, and spent quite some time digging through Wikipedia and
ultimately landed on the page for [protostar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar) (this is why
our logo's a star). We really liked the definition of protostar, as it basically means "the
beginning phase of a star". Even the the prefix proto means "first" or "earliest form of".

This was great as that's the impression we had in mind for our tool. proto is the first piece
required for setting up your developer environment. The toolchain is the first layer in the
foundation.

From an aesthetic standpoint, proto's typography works well with moon, as most of the letters are
circle shaped. Double points for proto having two o's like the other products!

### Are you worried about confusion with other tools like protobufs?

Nah.

### What is a tool?

A tool in the context of proto is either a language, dependency/package manager (typically for a
language), or third-party CLI. The tool is something that can be downloaded and installed _by
version_ onto a machine.

Furthermore, a tool should have a primary executable file that can be executed with `proto run` or
through proto's shims. Additionally, a tool can also provide secondary executable files. For
example, `npm` (the primary) also provides `npx` and `node-gyp` (secondaries).

### What is a backend?

A backend is a special type of tool that provides additional integration with 3rd-party plugins,
greatly expanding what can be installed and managed with proto.

### What is a plugin?

A plugin is a WASM (or JSON, TOML, YAML) file for a tool or backend.

The terms tool and plugin are often used interchangeably, but plugin primarily refers to the WASM
portion of a tool, while tool refers to the entire package: metadata, business logic, branding, so
on an so forth.

### Will you support more languages?

Yes! We'd love to support as many as possible, and if you'd like to help, join our Discord
community! Feel free to create a [plugin](./plugins) in the mean time.

### Will you support other kinds of tools?

No, we will only support languages, dependency managers, and CLIs, which should be enough. However,
you can create a [plugin](./plugins) to support other kinds of tools.

### Do you support "build from source"?

As of version 0.45, we do! Simple pass `--build` to `proto install`. However, building from source
is a complicated process and is unique per tool, so not all tools support it.

### How to run a canary release after installing it?

Once a tool has been installed with `--canary`, the canary version can be explicitly referenced
using our [version detection rules](./detection). The easiest approach is to prefix the shim with an
environment variable:

```shell
$ PROTO_BUN_VERSION=canary bun ./index.ts
```

Or to explicitly configure the version in [`.prototools`](./config):

```toml
bun = "canary"
```

### What kind of features are supported for HTTP requests?

proto makes a lot of HTTP requests, for information such as available versions/releases, and for
downloading the blobs/archives themselves. Because of this, we do our best to support all kinds of
internet connections, proxy and intranet usage, and more, through the following:

- All GET and HEAD requests are cached to `~/.proto/cache/requests` based on the
  [HTTP cache semantics](https://github.com/kornelski/rusty-http-cache-semantics) and relevant RFCs.
- We support the
  [netrc file format](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/manual/html_node/The-_002enetrc-file.html)
  and will automatically load `~/.netrc` if it exists.
- We support an offline mode that will short-circuit certain workflows if there's no internet
  connection. We check for a connection by pinging DNS endpoints, but this can be configured with
  [`[settings.offline]`](./config#settingsoffline).
- We attempt to automatically load root and system certifications so that secure connections work
  correctly. This can be configured with [`[settings.http]`](./config#settingshttp).

## Troubleshooting

### Network requests keep failing, how can I bypass?

When a tool is executed, we validate the version to ensure it's correct. We achieve this by making
network requests to a remote service to gather the list of valid versions. If you're having network
issues, or the request is timing out, you can bypass these checks with the following:

- Pass a fully-qualified version as an environment variable. The version must be installed for this
  to work.

  ```shell
  PROTO_NODE_VERSION=20.0.0 node --version
  ```

  If executing a Node.js package manager, you'll need to set versions for both Node.js and the
  manager. This is required since manager's execute `node` processes under the hood.

  ```shell
  PROTO_NODE_VERSION=20.0.0 PROTO_NPM_VERSION=10.0.0 npm --version
  ```

- Pass the `PROTO_BYPASS_VERSION_CHECK` environment variable. This will bypass the network request
  to load versions, but does not bypass other requests. However, this is typically enough.

  ```shell
  PROTO_BYPASS_VERSION_CHECK=1 node --version
  ```
