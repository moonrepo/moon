title: What is proto?
---

proto is a toolchain manager.

If you're unfamiliar with the concept of a toolchain, a toolchain is a collection of tools that are
downloaded, installed, and managed by version through a single interface. In the context of proto's
toolchain, a tool is either a programming language, or a dependency/package manager for a language.
It's the next step in the version manager evolution.

## Why proto?

proto was designed to be a modern and holistic version manager for all of your favorite programming
languages. We believe a single tool is better than multiple ad-hoc tools. While we only support a
handful of languages today, we aim to support many more in the future!

proto powers [moon](/moon)'s toolchain, enabling a single source of truth for both tools!

### Features

- Lightspeed! With Rust, we can guarantee exceptional performance.
- Multi-language. A single CLI for managing versions for all of your languages.
- Cross-platform, for a consistent experience across machines and teams.
- [Contextual version detection](./proto/detection), ensuring the correct version of a tool is
  always used.
- Checksum verification, ensuring a tool came from a trusted source.
- Detects and infers from a language's ecosystem for maximum compatibility.

## How does it work?

The toolchain is a `.proto` directory within the current user's home directory, e.g., `~/.proto`.

The first step in a tool's life-cycle is being downloaded to `~/.proto/temp`. Downloads are
typically an archive that can be unpacked into a target directory. Once downloaded, we verify the
downloaded file by verifying a checksum. If this check fails for _any reason_, the toolchain is
unusable, and the process is aborted.

After a successful verification, the last step in the tool's life-cycle can begin, installation.
Depending on the type of download, the installation process may differ. For archives, we unpack the
tool to `~/.proto/tools/<name>/<version>`. In the future, we'll support building from source.

### Shims

proto is powered the by industry standard concept of shims. For each tool installed in proto, a shim
file will exist at `~/.proto/bin/<tool>`. Shims _are not_ symlinks to the tool's binary, but are
thin wrappers around [`proto run`](./proto/commands/run), enabling
[automatic version detection](./proto/detection) on every invocation!

:::info

The `~/.proto/bin` directory _should_ be in your `PATH` if proto was setup correctly. If not, run
the [`proto setup`](./proto/commands/setup) command.

## Supported tools

The following tools are currently supported in proto:

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)**
- **[Deno](https://deno.land)**
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**
  - [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/)
  - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
  - [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- **[Go](https://go.dev)**

## Supported targets

Because proto is written in Rust, we only support targets that are explicitly compiled for, which
are currently:

| Operating system | Architecture | Target                     |
| :--------------- | :----------- | :------------------------- |
| macOS 64-bit     | Intel        | `x86_64-apple-darwin`      |
| macOS 64-bit     | ARM          | `aarch64-apple-darwin`     |
| Linux 64-bit     | Intel GNU    | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| Windows 64-bit   | Intel        | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`   |

<!--
| Linux 64-bit     | ARM GNU      | `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| Linux 64-bit     | Intel musl   | `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` |
| Linux 64-bit     | ARM musl     | `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` | -->

## Roadmap

- Windows shim support.
- Linux ARM/musl support.
- Custom version aliasing.
- Build from source for existing languages.
- New languages.
