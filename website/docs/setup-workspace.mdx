Once moon has been installed, we must setup the [workspace](./concepts/workspace), which is denoted
by the `.moon` folder — this is known as the workspace root. The workspace is in charge of:

- Integrating with a version control system.
- Defining configuration that applies to its entire tree.
- Housing [projects](./concepts/project) to build a project graph.
- Running tasks and the build system.

## Initializing the repository

Let's scaffold and initialize moon in a repository with the [`moon init`](./commands/init) command.
This should typically be ran at the root, but can be nested within a directory.

```shell
$ moon init
```

When executed, the following operations will be applied.

- Creates a `.moon` folder with associated [`.moon/workspace.yml`](./config/workspace),
  [`.moon/toolchain.yml`](./config/toolchain), and [`.moon/tasks.yml`](./config/tasks) configuration
  files.
- Appends necessary ignore patterns to the relative `.gitignore`.
- Infers languages and dependency managers to register in the toolchain.
- Infers the version control system from the environment.

:::info

If you're investigating moon, or merely want to prototype, you can use `moon init --minimal` to
quickly initialize and create minimal configuration files.

## Configuring a version control system

moon requires a version control system (VCS) to be present for functionality like file diffing,
hashing, and revision comparison. The VCS and its default branch can be configured through the
[`vcs`](./config/workspace#vcs) setting.

<Tabs
  groupId="vcs"
  defaultValue="git"
  values={[
    { label: 'git', value: 'git' },
    { label: 'svn', value: 'svn' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="git">

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
vcs:
	manager: 'git'
	defaultBranch: 'master'
```

> moon defaults to `git` and the settings above, so feel free to skip this.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="svn">

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
vcs:
	manager: 'svn'
	defaultBranch: 'trunk'
```

> SVN support is highly experimental and may not work properly!

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
